  "summary": "sub_40b9e0 is a wrapper around the Linux statx syscall that gathers file metadata and packs selected fields into a custom output structure. It first sets a flag in the provided options, invokes statx, and on success extracts mode, uid, gid, size, timestamps and other attributes, applying bit masks and shifts before storing them in the buffer pointed by arg3.",
  "details": [
    "The function modifies arg4 (likely the flags argument) by OR-ing the value 8 before calling statx with arg1, arg2, arg4, and arg5.",
    "After a successful statx call, it reads various fields from the statx result (e.g., mode, uid, gid, size, timestamps) and assembles them into a packed structure using bitwise masks such as 0xffffff00000, 0xfff00, and shifts, storing the result in the memory region referenced by arg3.",
    "It uses SSE intrinsics like _mm_unpacklo_epi32/_mm_unpacklo_epi64 to combine 32\u2011bit and 64\u2011bit parts of the statx data before writing them to the output buffer.",
    "Stack protection is present, referencing __stack_chk_fail in case of canary violation."
