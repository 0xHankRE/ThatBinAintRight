  "summary": "sub_4045d0 initializes a local variable to the constant 0x5a and then tail-calls sub_404020, which appears to be a minimal stub that sets its own local variable to zero and jumps to a null target, performing no meaningful work.",
  "details": [
    "A local variable var_8 is set to 0x5a in sub_4045d0.",
    "The function immediately tail-calls sub_404020 without further processing.",
    "sub_404020 sets its own var_8 to 0 and then jumps to a nullptr, effectively acting as a no-op.",
    "No external imports, strings, or complex logic are present."
