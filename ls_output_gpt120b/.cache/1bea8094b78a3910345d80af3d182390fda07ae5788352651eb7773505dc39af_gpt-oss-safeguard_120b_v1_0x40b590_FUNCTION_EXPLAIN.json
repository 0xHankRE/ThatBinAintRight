  "summary": "sub_40b590 resizes a container by computing a required element count, allocating a new buffer with calloc, copying existing data via sub_409b80, freeing the old buffer, and updating the container's metadata; it returns success if the new allocation and copy succeed, otherwise it handles errors and may abort.",
  "details": [
    "Calls sub_4168e0 to compute the number of elements (nmemb) needed based on input arguments.",
    "If the computed size is zero, the function returns failure; if it matches the current size stored in arg1[2], it returns success without changes.",
    "Otherwise it allocates a new buffer of nmemb * 0x10 bytes using calloc.",
    "On successful allocation, it attempts to copy existing data into the new buffer via sub_409b80; if successful, it frees the old buffer, updates the structure fields (pointer, size, and other saved values), and returns success.",
    "If any step fails, it retrieves errno, may attempt cleanup or rollback, and ultimately returns failure (potentially invoking abort on critical errors)."
