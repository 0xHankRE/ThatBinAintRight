  "summary": "sub_409cf0 is a thin wrapper that forwards its second argument to sub_413ce0, passing a zero as the first argument and a pointer to a global data structure at 0x423040 as the third argument. The function performs a tail call, returning whatever sub_413ce0 returns.",
  "details": [
    "The function consists of a single tailcall instruction: return sub_413ce0(0, arg1, &data_423040);",
    "It does not import any external symbols or reference any string literals directly.",
    "The constant address 0x423040 likely points to a global buffer or configuration used by sub_413ce0."
