  "summary": "sub_408ce0 recursively sorts an array of 128\u2011bit elements (two doubles) using a user\u2011supplied comparator, swapping elements when out of order and handling small sub\u2011arrays directly.",
  "details": [
    "The function splits the input range using bit\u2011shifts (>>1, >>2) and recursively calls itself on sub\u2011ranges.",
    "For sub\u2011ranges of size 2 it loads a 128\u2011bit value, calls the comparator arg4 on the two double components, and swaps them via _mm_shuffle_pd if needed.",
    "Base cases for sizes <=2 are handled directly; larger ranges trigger further recursion.",
    "The function imports memcpy but does not appear to use it in the shown code; it may be used in omitted sections for moving data."
