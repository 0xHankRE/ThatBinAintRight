  "summary": "sub_40ac10 compares two objects based on a type field at offset 0x15 and a flag field at offset 0xac, returning a numeric ordering when certain type codes (3 or 9) or flag bits (0x4000) differ; otherwise it delegates to sub_40ab80 which performs a string comparison of file extensions and full names.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a byte/word at offset 0x15 from each argument and checks for values 3 or 9, setting a combined flag rdx_1.",
    "Masks a 32\u2011bit value at offset 0xac with 0xf000 and compares it against 0x4000 to influence the return value.",
    "If the early checks do not determine ordering, the function tail\u2011calls sub_40ab80 to compare file extensions and then full strings.",
    "Returns the difference of the flag values when mismatched, otherwise passes control to the string comparator."
