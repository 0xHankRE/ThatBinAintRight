  "summary": "The function compares two structures (arg1 and arg2) based on a type field, a flag mask, and two numeric fields, and if they match it delegates to strcmp to compare their string members.",
  "details": [
    "It checks the value at offset 0x15 of each argument; only values 3 or 9 trigger further comparison.",
    "It tests a flag at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 against 0x4000 for both structures.",
    "It compares the 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0x10 and 0x11 of the two structures, computing a combined result that is zero only when both pairs match.",
    "When all conditions are satisfied, it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure, returning the strcmp result."
