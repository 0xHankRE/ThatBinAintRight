  "summary": "sub_40a190 compares two file-like structures, first checking special type codes and directory flags, then delegating to sub_40a110 for timestamp and name comparison, effectively implementing a sort order that prioritizes directories and handles special cases.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a field at offset 0x15 from both arguments and checks for values 3 or 9, setting a flag if either matches.",
    "If the second argument has type 3 or 9, it sets a base comparison result of 1; otherwise it extracts the mode bits at offset 0xac, masks with 0xf000, and checks for the directory flag 0x4000.",
    "When the type flag is not set, it compares the directory flag of the first argument against the expected value and returns a difference if they differ.",
    "If the preliminary checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40a110, which compares timestamps (fields at 0x10/0x11) and finally falls back to a locale\u2011aware string comparison via strcoll.",
    "The function returns early with a numeric ordering when directory status or special type codes differ, otherwise it defers to the more detailed comparator."
