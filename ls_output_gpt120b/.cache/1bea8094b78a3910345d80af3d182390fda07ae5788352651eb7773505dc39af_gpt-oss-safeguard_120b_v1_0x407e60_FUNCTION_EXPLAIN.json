  "summary": "The function compares two data structures: it first checks that the second and third fields of both structures are equal, then performs a string comparison on the first field using strcmp, returning 1 if all checks match and 0 otherwise.",
  "details": [
    "If arg1[1] != arg2[1] or arg1[2] != arg2[2], the function immediately returns 0.",
    "Otherwise it calls strcmp on the pointers stored at arg1[0] and arg2[0] and returns the boolean result of that comparison."
