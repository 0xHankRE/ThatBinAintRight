  "summary": "sub_4090e0 prints the command-line usage/help text for a GNU coreutils utility (likely ls), using localized strings via dcgettext and writing to stdout, then may exit based on the argument flag.",
  "details": [
    "If the first argument is false (e.g., no arguments or error), it prints a formatted usage line with __printf_chk and a series of option descriptions with fputs_unlocked, all retrieved via dcgettext for localization.",
    "The function references many option strings typical of ls (e.g., -a, -A, --color) and includes usage and help messages, indicating it serves as the help routine for the utility."
