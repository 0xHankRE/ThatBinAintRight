  "summary": "sub_416b20 validates a pathname argument, sets appropriate errno values for null or empty inputs, and builds a normalized absolute path using a 0x400\u2011byte buffer. It distinguishes absolute paths (starting with '/') from relative ones, uses getcwd for the latter, and employs dynamic allocation and safe copying to assemble the final path.",
  "details": [
    "If arg1 is NULL, errno is set to 0x16 (EINVAL) and the function returns 0.",
    "If the first byte of arg1 is zero, errno is set to 2 (ENOENT) and the function returns 0.",
    "When the path starts with '/', the function initializes a buffer with '/' and proceeds to canonicalize the path.",
    "For relative paths, it likely calls getcwd to obtain the current working directory and prepends it to the supplied path.",
    "Memory for temporary buffers is allocated with malloc/realloc and freed with free; copies are performed with __memcpy_chk for safety.",
    "The function may abort on unrecoverable errors via the imported abort routine."
