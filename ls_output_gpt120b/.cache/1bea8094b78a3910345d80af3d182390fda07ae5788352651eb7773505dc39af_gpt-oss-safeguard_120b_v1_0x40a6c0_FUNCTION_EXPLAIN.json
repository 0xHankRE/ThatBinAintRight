  "summary": "sub_40a6c0 implements a comparator that first orders two objects by comparing 64\u2011bit fields at offsets 0xE and 0xF. If those fields differ, it returns a signed integer indicating the ordering. When the fields are equal, it falls back to a locale\u2011aware string comparison of the pointers stored at the start of each object, after clearing errno.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[0xE] and arg2[0xE] and computes a signed result based on < and > comparisons.",
    "Loads arg1[0xF] and arg2[0xF] and combines the two comparison results into a single integer using bitwise operations.",
    "If the combined result is non\u2011zero, it is returned directly.",
    "If the result is zero, the function retrieves the first pointer from each structure, resets errno to 0, and calls strcoll to compare the referenced strings."
