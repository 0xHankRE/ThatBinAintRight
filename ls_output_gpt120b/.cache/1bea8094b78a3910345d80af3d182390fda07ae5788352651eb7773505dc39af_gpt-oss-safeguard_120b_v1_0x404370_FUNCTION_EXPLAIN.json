  "summary": "sub_404370 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x34 and then tail-calls sub_404020, which appears to be a stub that does nothing and returns.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets a stack variable var_8 to the constant 0x34 before performing a tail call to sub_404020.",
    "sub_404020 sets its own var_8 to 0 and then jumps to a null pointer, indicating no further action."
