  "summary": "sub_409da0 is a thin wrapper that forwards its two arguments to sub_409d10 in swapped order, supplying strcmp as the comparison routine, effectively comparing the file extensions of two strings.",
  "details": [
    "The function performs a tail-call to sub_409d10 with arguments (arg2, arg1, strcmp).",
    "sub_409d10 extracts the substring after the last '.' in each input string using strrchr and then calls the provided comparator (strcmp) on those substrings."
