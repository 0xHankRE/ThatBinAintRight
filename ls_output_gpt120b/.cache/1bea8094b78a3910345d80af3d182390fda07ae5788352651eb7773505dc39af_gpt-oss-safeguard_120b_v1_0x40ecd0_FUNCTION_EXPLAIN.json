  "summary": "sub_40ecd0 dispatches processing based on a mode flag (arg2) and a global flag (data_423342), extracts values from a complex structure, invokes sub_40e910 to perform formatted output or data handling, and then calls sub_40bf40 to flush output and manage pending signals. It also contains conditional logic that selects different fields and lookup tables depending on flag values.",
  "details": [
    "If arg2 is zero, the function uses a pointer from arg1[0] and, when the global flag is set, reads a byte at offset 0xb9 to decide which field (0xac or arg1[6]) to pass to later processing.",
    "When arg2 is non-zero, it uses arg1[1] as a pointer and similarly selects fields based on the global flag and other structure offsets, including a lookup in data_419620 indexed by arg1[0x15].",
    "The core operation is a call to sub_40e910 with parameters including a global data_4235a0, a value from arg1+0xc4, a XORed arg2 flag, and other fields; this likely formats or logs data.",
    "After sub_40e910 returns, sub_40bf40 is called, which flushes output streams and handles signal-related cleanup.",
    "The function references helper routines sub_40bbb0 (numeric checks) and sub_40be90 (cleanup), indicating it may validate or reset internal state before or after processing."
