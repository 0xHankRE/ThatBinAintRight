  "summary": "sub_40a370 compares two structures based on a type flag at offset 0x15 and a masked field at offset 0xac, returning a difference if they differ, otherwise delegating to sub_40a300 for further numeric and locale-aware string comparison.",
  "details": [
    "It checks if arg1[0x15] or arg2[0x15] equal the values 3 or 9, using those as special cases that set a boolean flag.",
    "It extracts a 0xf000 mask from the 0xac field of each argument and tests for the value 0x4000, using the result to compute a comparison value.",
    "If the computed comparison values differ, it returns their difference; otherwise it tail\u2011calls sub_40a300, which compares additional numeric fields and finally uses strcoll for locale\u2011aware string ordering."
