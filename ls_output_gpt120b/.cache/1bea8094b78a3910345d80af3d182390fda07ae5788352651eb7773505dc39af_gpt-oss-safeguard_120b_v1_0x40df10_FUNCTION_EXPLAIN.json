  "summary": "The function walks a linked list of memory blocks stored in a structure at arg1+8, computes each block's size by subtracting its base address from its end address, accumulates the sizes, and returns the total memory used.",
  "details": [
    "It retrieves the head of the block list from offset 8 of the argument structure.",
    "In a loop, it calculates each block's size as *(uint64_t*)i - i, adds it to a running total, and moves to the next block via i[1].",
    "The loop terminates when the block pointer is null, and the accumulated total is returned."
