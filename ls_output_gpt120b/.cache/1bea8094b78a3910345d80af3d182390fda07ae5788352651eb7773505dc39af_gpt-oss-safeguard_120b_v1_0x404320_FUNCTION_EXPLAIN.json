  "summary": "sub_404320 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x2f and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, which appears to be a stub that does nothing and returns.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets var_8 = 0x2f but does not use it before transferring control.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020, which only sets var_8 = 0 and jumps to a null pointer, indicating no meaningful operation."
