  "summary": "sub_414030 prepares a small stack frame, initializes a constant vector and a flag value, then forwards the call to sub_413ce0 with arguments (0, arg1, &var_48) and returns its result, while enforcing stack canary protection.",
  "details": [
    "Loads a 128\u2011bit constant from data_41db00 into a local variable and zeroes another buffer.",
    "Sets a local integer var_48 to 3 and passes its address to sub_413ce0 along with a zero and the original argument.",
    "After the call, verifies the stack canary stored at FS:0x28; on mismatch it invokes __stack_chk_fail."
