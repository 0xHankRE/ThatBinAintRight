  "summary": "sub_40b0f0 implements a two\u2011stage comparison of two objects: it first compares a cached numeric value (or computes it via sub_40b040 if missing) and, if those values are equal, falls back to a lexical strcmp of the objects' string fields.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a 64\u2011bit field at offset 0x19 from each argument; if zero it calls sub_40b040 to compute a value using the object's primary pointer, a global (data_4235a0), and a field at offset 0xc4.",
    "If the numeric values differ, the function returns their difference; otherwise it returns the result of strcmp on the two objects' string pointers.",
    "The function imports strcmp and calls sub_40b040 (address 0x40b040) and strcmp (address 0x4046c0) as shown in the evidence."
