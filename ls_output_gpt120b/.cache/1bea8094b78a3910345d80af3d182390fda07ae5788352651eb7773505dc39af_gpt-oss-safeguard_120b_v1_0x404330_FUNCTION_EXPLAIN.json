  "summary": "sub_404330 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x30 and then tail-calls sub_404020, returning whatever that function returns. sub_404020 appears to be a stub that jumps to a null pointer, likely performing no meaningful work.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets a stack variable var_8 to the constant 0x30 but does not use it before the tail call.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020 and returns its result directly."
