  "summary": "sub_40bd80 is a small lookup routine that returns specific constant values based on masked bits of arg2 when arg1 is true, or based on arg3 when arg1 is false. The returned constants (0x2f, 0x40, 0x7c, 0x3d, or 0) are further conditioned by a global flag data_423334, suggesting it selects formatting widths or type identifiers for later processing.",
  "details": [
    "If arg1 is non\u2011zero, the function masks arg2 with 0xf000 and returns values: 0x2f for 0x4000, 0x40 for 0xa000, 0x7c for 0x1000, 0x3d for 0xc000, otherwise 0; special handling for 0x8000 when data_423334 equals 3 returns 0.",
    "If arg1 is zero, the function examines arg3 and returns similar constants (0x40 for 6, 0x7c for 1, etc.) unless data_423334 equals 1, in which case it returns 0.",
    "The global variable data_423334 influences several branches, acting as a mode flag that can suppress or alter the returned values."
