  "summary": "The function implements a comparator that first orders two objects by two integer fields at offsets 0xe and 0xf, returning a signed result based on those fields; if the fields are equal it falls back to a locale-aware string comparison of the objects' name pointers.",
  "details": [
    "It loads 64\u2011bit values from arg1[0xe] and arg2[0xe] and computes a signed result using < and > comparisons, weighting this comparison by 2.",
    "It then loads values from arg1[0xf] and arg2[0xf] and adds a secondary comparison weighted by 1 to the result.",
    "If the combined result is non\u2011zero, it returns that value as the ordering indicator.",
    "When the integer fields are equal, it retrieves the first pointer from each structure, clears errno via __errno_location, and calls strcoll to compare the strings.",
    "The function thus provides a lexicographic ordering: primary integer field, secondary integer field, then string name."
