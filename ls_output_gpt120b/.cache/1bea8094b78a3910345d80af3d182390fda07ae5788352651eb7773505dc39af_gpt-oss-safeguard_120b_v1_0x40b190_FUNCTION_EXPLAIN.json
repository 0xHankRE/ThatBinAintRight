  "summary": "sub_40b190 compares two objects by inspecting a type field at offset 0x15 and a flag field at offset 0xac, returning a numeric difference if they differ, otherwise delegating to sub_40b0f0 for deeper comparison. It handles special type values 3 and 9, checks a high-order nibble mask (0xf000) against 0x4000, and uses the result to decide whether to return early or call the secondary comparator.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a 32-bit value at offset 0x15 from each argument and checks for values 3 or 9, setting a combined flag rdx_1.",
    "If either argument has type 3 or 9, it sets a default result of 1 and may compare the masked flag at offset 0xac against this result.",
    "If neither argument has those types, it extracts the flag bit from arg2's offset 0xac, compares it to the flag from arg1, and may return the difference.",
    "When no early return occurs, it tail-calls sub_40b0f0, which further compares other fields and finally performs a strcmp on string pointers."
