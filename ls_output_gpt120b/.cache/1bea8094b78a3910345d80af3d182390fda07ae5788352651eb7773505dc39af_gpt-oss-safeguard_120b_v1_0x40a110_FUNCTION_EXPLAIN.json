  "summary": "The function compares two structured objects by examining two integer fields at offsets 0x10 and 0x11, computes a composite ordering value, and if the objects are otherwise equal it clears errno and performs a locale-aware string comparison using strcoll, returning the resulting ordering integer.",
  "details": [
    "It loads 64\u2011bit values from arg1[0x10] and arg2[0x10] and sets flags based on < and > comparisons, then does the same for offsets 0x11.",
    "A result is calculated from the comparison flags: ((rdx - (uint8_t)rax) << 1) + ((uint8_t)rax_2 - cond:1). If non\u2011zero, this result is returned as the ordering.",
    "When the result is zero (fields equal), the function retrieves the first pointer from each argument, clears errno via __errno_location(), and tail\u2011calls strcoll to compare the pointed\u2011to strings, returning that result."
