  "summary": "The function compares two structures based on a type field, a flag mask, a numeric field, and finally a string field. It first checks if either structure has a type of 3 or 9, then verifies a specific flag (0x4000) in a masked word at offset 0xac. If those checks match, it compares a numeric value at offset 9; if those also match, it delegates to strcmp to compare the strings pointed to by the structures. If any check fails, it returns a simple integer difference derived from the flag comparison.",
  "details": [
    "Loads type values from offset 0x15 of both arguments and sets a boolean if the type equals 3 or 9.",
    "Checks a flag by masking a dword at offset 0xac with 0xf000 and comparing to 0x4000 for each structure.",
    "If flag checks succeed, compares a numeric field at offset 9 of both structures, producing a signed difference.",
    "When the numeric fields are equal, calls strcmp on the first pointer of each structure and returns its result.",
    "If any earlier condition fails, returns the difference of the flag check results or a constant based on type presence."
