  "summary": "sub_40a460 compares two objects (likely file entries) by checking a type field and a mode flag, returning an ordering based on those checks, and otherwise delegates to sub_40a3f0 which compares timestamps and finally falls back to lexical name comparison via strcoll.",
  "details": [
    "It reads a byte at offset 0x15 of each argument and treats values 3 or 9 as special type markers, setting a flag rdx_1.",
    "If the second argument has type 3 or 9, it sets a default comparison result of 1; otherwise it extracts the high bits of a 32\u2011bit field at offset 0xac, masks with 0xf000 and compares against 0x4000 (directory flag).",
    "When the type flag is not set, it compares the derived boolean flags of both arguments and returns their difference if they differ.",
    "If the type checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40a3f0 which compares fields at offsets 0xc and 0xd (likely timestamps) and finally uses strcoll to compare string names.",
    "The function returns early with a non\u2011zero integer when the type or mode flags differ, otherwise it falls back to the more detailed comparison."
