  "summary": "The function at 0x404c40 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its arguments to the standard library fseeko function and returns its result.",
  "details": [
    "It imports the fseeko symbol and makes a tail-call to it with the same parameters (fp, offset, whence).",
    "No additional logic, checks, or side effects are performed; it simply returns the value from fseeko."

    "The reason for providing this wrapper (e.g., abstraction layer or compatibility shim) is not evident from the code."
