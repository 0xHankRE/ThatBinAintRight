  "summary": "The function is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its arguments to the standard library wcstombs function and returns its result, performing a wide-character to multibyte string conversion.",
  "details": [
    "It imports the wcstombs symbol and makes a tail call to it with parameters (s, pwcs, n).",
    "No additional logic, string literals, or error handling is present; it simply returns the wcstombs return value."
