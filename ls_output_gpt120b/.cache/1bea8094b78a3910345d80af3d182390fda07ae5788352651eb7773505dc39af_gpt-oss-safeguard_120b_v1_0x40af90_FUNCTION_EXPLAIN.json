  "summary": "The function formats output to a fixed width. If the first argument is NULL it prints a numeric value using a \"%*lu \" format and updates a global counter. If a string is provided it computes its display width, prints the string, then pads the output with spaces until the desired width is reached, also updating the counter.",
  "details": [
    "When arg1 is NULL, __printf_chk is called with format \"%*lu \" using arg3 as field width and arg2 as the value, and the number of characters printed is added to data_423350.",
    "When arg1 is non\u2011NULL, sub_4140a0 is called to compute the printable width of the string (likely handling multibyte characters).",
    "The string is output via sub_408170, then a loop writes space characters directly to stdout until the total printed width matches arg3.",
    "Each space written increments the global counter data_423350, and the function returns a pointer to the last written character."
