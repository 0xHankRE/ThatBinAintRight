  "summary": "sub_409a50 implements a hash-table lookup with optional removal or reordering of entries. It computes a bucket index via a function pointer, validates bounds, traverses a linked list in the bucket, and may adjust the list based on a flag before returning the found value.",
  "details": [
    "Calls a function pointer at arg1+0x30 to compute an index from arg2 and the table size stored at arg1+0x10; aborts if the index is out of range (imports:abort, call:0x404750).",
    "Calculates the bucket address using (index << 4) + base pointer from arg1, then walks the chain comparing stored keys with arg2 using a comparator at arg1+0x38.",
    "If a matching entry is found and arg4 is true, it may remove or move the entry by updating pointers and linking the old node into a free list stored at arg1+0x48.",
    "Returns the key/value (r12) of the matching entry or continues scanning the chain until the end."
