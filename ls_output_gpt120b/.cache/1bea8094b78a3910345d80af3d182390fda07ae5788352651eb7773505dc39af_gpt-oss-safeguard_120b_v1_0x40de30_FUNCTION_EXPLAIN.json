  "summary": "The function walks a linked list of memory blocks stored in a structure at arg1 and checks whether the address arg2 falls within any of those blocks, returning true (1) if it does and false (0) otherwise.",
  "details": [
    "Loads a pointer from offset 8 of arg1, treating it as the head of a linked list of block descriptors.",
    "Iterates through each block: if arg2 is greater than the block's start address (i) and less than or equal to the block's end address stored at *i, it returns 1.",
    "Continues traversal via the second field of each block (i[1]) until the list ends, then returns 0 if no matching block is found."
