  "summary": "sub_412420 determines the block size to use by checking a provided argument or environment variables (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCKSIZE) and falling back to a default of 512 bytes when POSIXLY_CORRECT is set. It parses the value, handling optional leading quotes and unit suffixes (e.g., K, M, G) via sub_411f60, and stores the resulting size in global variables data_4232d0 and a flag in data_4232dc.",
  "details": [
    "If arg1 is NULL, the function queries the environment for BLOCK_SIZE or BLOCKSIZE; if none are found it checks POSIXLY_CORRECT and defaults to 0x200 (512) bytes.",
    "When a string is provided (or retrieved), a leading single quote is stripped and a flag is set, then sub_411e70 is called to match known size descriptors.",
    "If sub_411e70 fails, sub_411f60 parses the string as a numeric value with optional unit suffixes defined by the string \"eEgGkKmMpPtTyYzZ0\".",
    "The parsed block size is stored in data_4232d0, and data_4232dc is updated to indicate whether a custom size was successfully parsed."
