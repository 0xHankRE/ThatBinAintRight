  "summary": "sub_410fc0 opens a directory, reports errors if it cannot be opened, then iterates over its entries while tracking visited directories to avoid duplicate processing. It prints status messages such as \"reading directory\" and \"total\", and updates counters before closing the directory. The function uses standard POSIX directory APIs and localized error messages.",
  "details": [
    "Calls opendir on the provided path and checks for a NULL return; on failure it uses dcgettext to fetch a localized error string and forwards it to sub_40bc10 for reporting.",
    "If the directory opens successfully, it accesses global data structures (e.g., data_4236f8) to manage state, reads entries with readdir, and may recursively process subdirectories while avoiding already-listed directories using device/inode checks.",
    "Writes output to stdout, including newline handling and a \"total\" line, and updates counters such as data_423350.",
    "Closes the directory with closedir and cleans up allocated resources via free."
