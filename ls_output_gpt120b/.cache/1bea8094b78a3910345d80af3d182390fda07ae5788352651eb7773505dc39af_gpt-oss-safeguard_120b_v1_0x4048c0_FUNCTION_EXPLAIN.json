  "summary": "The function at 0x4048c0 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its three arguments (domainname, msgid, category) to the imported glibc dcgettext function and returns its result.",
  "details": [
    "It performs a tail call to dcgettext with the same parameters, without any additional processing.",
    "The wrapper is used throughout the binary (101 callers) to retrieve localized strings."
