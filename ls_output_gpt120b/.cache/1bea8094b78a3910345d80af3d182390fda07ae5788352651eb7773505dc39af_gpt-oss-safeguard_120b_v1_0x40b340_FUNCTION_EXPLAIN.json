  "summary": "The function compares two objects by first checking a cached integer at offset 0x19, computing it via sub_40b040 if missing, then returning the integer difference; if the integers match it clears errno and performs a locale-aware string comparison using strcoll on the objects' primary string pointers.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a cached value at offset 0x19 from each argument; if zero, calls sub_40b040 with the object's base pointer, a global data pointer, and a field at offset 0xc4 to compute the value.",
    "If the computed/ cached integers differ, returns their signed difference.",
    "If they are equal, resets errno to 0 via __errno_location and returns the result of strcoll on the two objects' string pointers (first field of each structure)."
