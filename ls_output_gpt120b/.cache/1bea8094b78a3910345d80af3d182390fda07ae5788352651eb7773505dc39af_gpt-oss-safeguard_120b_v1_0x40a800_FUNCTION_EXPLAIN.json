  "summary": "The function implements a two\u2011stage comparator: it first compares a 64\u2011bit integer located at index 9 of each argument and returns -1, 0, or 1 based on that ordering; if the integers are equal it falls back to a locale\u2011aware string comparison of the pointers stored at index 0 using strcoll.",
  "details": [
    "Reads int64 values from arg1[9] and arg2[9] and determines which is greater, returning -1 or 1 when they differ.",
    "When the integer fields are equal, loads the first element of each argument as a char* and calls strcoll after clearing errno.",
    "Uses __errno_location to reset errno before invoking strcoll."
