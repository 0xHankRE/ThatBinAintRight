  "summary": "The function compares two objects based on a type field (offset 0x15) and a flag mask (0xf000 == 0x4000), then optionally compares numeric fields at offsets 0x10 and 0x11, and finally delegates to strcmp on the objects' string members if all checks succeed.",
  "details": [
    "It first checks if arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] are either 3 or 9, setting a flag rsi accordingly.",
    "If the type matches, it verifies a flag in each object's 0xac field using the mask 0xf000 against 0x4000.",
    "When the flag condition holds, it compares the 0x10 and 0x11 fields of both objects with a mixed <, > logic, producing a zero result only when they match the expected ordering.",
    "If all conditions are satisfied, the function tail\u2011calls strcmp on the first 8\u2011byte member of each object, effectively comparing their string identifiers."
