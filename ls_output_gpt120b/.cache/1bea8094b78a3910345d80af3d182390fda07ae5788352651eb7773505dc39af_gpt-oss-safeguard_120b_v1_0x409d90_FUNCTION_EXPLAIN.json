  "summary": "sub_409d90 forwards its arguments to sub_409d10, using strcmp as a comparator, effectively comparing the file extensions of two strings.",
  "details": [
    "The function performs a tail call to sub_409d10 with the original two arguments and the strcmp function pointer.",
    "sub_409d10 extracts the substring after the last '.' in each input string using strrchr, substitutes a default string when a dot is missing, and then calls the passed comparator (strcmp) on those substrings."

  "evidence_refs": [

    "strings:'[A\\\\A]A^]'"

  "unknowns": [
    "Exact behavior when the comparator returns zero (i.e., extensions match) due to missing code after the conditional.",
    "The content and purpose of data_41af54 used as a fallback string."
