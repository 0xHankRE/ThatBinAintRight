  "summary": "sub_404500 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x4d and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, effectively delegating its work to that function.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets a stack variable var_8 to the constant 0x4d, which appears unused.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020 and returns whatever that function returns."
