  "summary": "sub_408fc0 allocates and initializes a small structure that stores a string argument. If the argument is NULL it allocates a default 0x80\u2011byte block with zeroed fields; otherwise it allocates enough space for the string plus a header, sets a flag, copies the string, and ensures null termination. The function returns a pointer to this newly allocated structure.",
  "details": [
    "When arg1 is NULL, the function calls malloc(0x80) and initializes the first two 64\u2011bit fields to zero.",
    "When arg1 is non\u2011NULL, it computes the string length with strlen, chooses a buffer size of max(0x76, length+1) rounded up to an 8\u2011byte boundary, allocates it, sets the first field to zero, the second field to 1, copies the string into the buffer at offset 9 using __memcpy_chk, and appends a terminating NUL.",
    "The allocated block is likely a custom struct where the first 8 bytes hold a status or pointer, the next byte is a flag, and the remaining bytes hold the string data."
