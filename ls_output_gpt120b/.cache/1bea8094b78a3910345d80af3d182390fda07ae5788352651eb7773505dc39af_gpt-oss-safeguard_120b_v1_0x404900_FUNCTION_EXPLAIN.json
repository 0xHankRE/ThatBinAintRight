  "summary": "This function is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its parameters to the standard library getopt_long function and returns its result, performing no additional processing.",
  "details": [
    "The implementation consists solely of a tailcall to getopt_long with the same arguments (argc, argv, options, long_options, opt_index).",
    "No extra logic, string handling, or side effects are present; it serves as a simple pass\u2011through for command\u2011line option parsing."
