  "summary": "sub_40e470 allocates a 16\u2011byte block, aborts with a memory\u2011exhausted error if allocation fails, packs the function argument together with a global pointer into a 128\u2011bit value, stores it in the new block, updates the global pointer, and returns the allocated block.",
  "details": [
    "Calls malloc(0x10) to obtain a 16\u2011byte buffer; on failure it calls sub_40e430 which prints \"memory exhausted\" and aborts.",
    "Creates a 128\u2011bit value where the lower 64 bits are the input argument and the upper 64 bits are the previous value of the global data_423458 (shifted left 64 bits).",
    "Writes this 128\u2011bit value into the allocated buffer, updates data_423458 to point to the new buffer, and returns the buffer pointer."
