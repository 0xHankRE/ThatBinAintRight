  "summary": "The function compares two structures' type fields (offset 0x15) against values 3 and 9, checks a flag in each structure at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 for the value 0x4000, and ensures consistency between them. If the checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_409d10 to compare the file extensions of two strings using strcmp; otherwise it returns a difference indicating a mismatch.",
  "details": [
    "Reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] and sets flags based on whether they equal 3 or 9.",
    "Masks a 32\u2011bit field at offset 0xac with 0xf000 and checks for 0x4000, using this to influence the return value.",
    "If the type and flag checks succeed, it calls sub_409d10 with strcmp to compare the substrings after the last '.' in the two input strings.",
    "Returns a numeric difference (rax_3 - rcx) when the flag or type checks fail, indicating a mismatch."
