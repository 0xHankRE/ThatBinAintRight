  "summary": "The function at 0x404b00 is a thin wrapper that returns the file descriptor of a FILE* by directly calling the standard library fileno function.",
  "details": [
    "It receives a FILE* pointer (fp) as its argument and immediately returns the result of fileno(fp), performing a tail call.",
    "No additional processing, error handling, or side effects are present; it simply forwards the call to the imported fileno routine."
