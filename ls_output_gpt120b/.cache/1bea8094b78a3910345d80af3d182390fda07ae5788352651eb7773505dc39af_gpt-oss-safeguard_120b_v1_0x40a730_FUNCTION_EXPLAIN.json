  "summary": "sub_40a730 implements a conditional comparator that first checks specific type codes (3 or 9) in two structures, then evaluates a masked flag at offset 0xac, returning a difference if they disagree; otherwise it forwards the comparison to sub_40a6c0 for further ordering logic.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a byte at offset 0x15 from both arguments and sets flags when the value equals 3 or 9.",
    "If either argument has a type of 3 or 9, it checks whether the high nibble of the dword at offset 0xac matches 0x4000, and returns the boolean difference if mismatched.",
    "When the type codes are not 3 or 9, it performs the same mask check on the second argument and returns a difference if needed.",
    "If all preliminary checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40a6c0, which performs further numeric comparisons and finally a locale\u2011aware string comparison (strcoll)."
