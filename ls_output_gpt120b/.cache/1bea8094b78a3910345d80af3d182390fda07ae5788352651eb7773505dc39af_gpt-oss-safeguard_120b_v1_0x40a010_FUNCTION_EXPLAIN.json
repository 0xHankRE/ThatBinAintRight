  "summary": "sub_40a010 compares two structures by examining the 0x10 and 0x11 fields; it returns a non\u2011zero integer if those fields differ, otherwise it clears errno and delegates to strcoll to compare the strings pointed to by the structures' first members.",
  "details": [
    "The function loads 64\u2011bit values at offset 0x10 from both arguments and computes a signed result based on <, > comparisons of those values and the values at offset 0x11.",
    "If the computed result is non\u2011zero, it is returned directly; otherwise the function retrieves the pointers stored at offset 0 of each argument, resets errno to 0 via __errno_location, and calls strcoll on the two strings."
