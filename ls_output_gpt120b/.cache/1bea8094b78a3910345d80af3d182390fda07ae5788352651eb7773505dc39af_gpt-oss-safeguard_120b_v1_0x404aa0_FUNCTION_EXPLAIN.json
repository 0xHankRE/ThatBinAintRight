  "summary": "The function at 0x404aa0 is a thin wrapper that directly tail\u2011calls the imported __memcpy_chk routine, passing through all four arguments and returning its result. It performs no additional logic beyond delegating to the library implementation of the bounds\u2011checked memcpy.",
  "details": [
    "The body consists solely of a tailcall to __memcpy_chk with the same arguments (arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4).",
    "It is referenced by other functions (e.g., sub_408fc0 and sub_40c5e0) that rely on safe memory copying."
