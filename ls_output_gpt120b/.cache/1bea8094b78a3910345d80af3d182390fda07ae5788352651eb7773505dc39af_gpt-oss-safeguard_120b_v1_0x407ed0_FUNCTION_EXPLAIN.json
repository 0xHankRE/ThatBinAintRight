  "summary": "sub_407ed0 implements an obstack chunk allocation routine: it determines the chunk size, selects an allocation function based on a flag, attempts to allocate memory, aligns the returned block, updates the obstack structure, and falls back to an error handler on failure.",
  "details": [
    "If arg3 (requested chunk size) is zero, defaults to 0x10 bytes with a header of 0xf; otherwise uses arg3 and arg3-1 for alignment calculations.",
    "If arg2 (initial chunk size) is zero, defaults to 0xfe0 (a typical obstack default).",
    "Selects the allocation function stored at arg1[7] or arg1[9] depending on the low bit of arg1[0xa] and calls it with the chosen size.",
    "On allocation failure, calls sub_407f90 (the obstack allocation failure handler) and returns its result.",
    "When allocation succeeds, aligns the returned pointer using a mask derived from r12, stores the aligned pointer in the obstack, updates bookkeeping fields (arg1[1], arg1[4], arg1[6], arg1[0xa]), and returns 1."
