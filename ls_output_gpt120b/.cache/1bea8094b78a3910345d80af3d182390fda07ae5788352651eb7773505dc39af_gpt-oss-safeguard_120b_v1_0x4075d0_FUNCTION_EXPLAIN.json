  "summary": "The function compares two structures by first evaluating the 64\u2011bit values at offset 0xC, then at offset 0xD, and finally falling back to a lexical strcmp of the strings pointed to by the first field of each structure, returning an integer ordering result.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[0xC] and arg2[0xC] and determines ordering using < and > comparisons.",
    "If the first numeric fields are equal, it compares arg1[0xD] and arg2[0xD] similarly.",
    "When both numeric fields match, it calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
