  "summary": "sub_404420 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x3f and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, which appears to be a stub that sets a local variable to zero and jumps to a null address, effectively doing nothing useful.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets var_8 = 0x3f but never uses it before transferring control.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020, delegating any further behavior.",
    "sub_404020 sets its own var_8 = 0 and then jumps to a nullptr, indicating a placeholder or no\u2011op implementation."
