  "summary": "The function implements a three-stage comparator: it first compares 64-bit values at offset 0x10 of the two arguments, then compares values at offset 0x11 if the first comparison is equal, and finally falls back to a lexical string comparison using strcmp on the pointers at the start of each structure. It returns a non-zero integer indicating ordering, otherwise the strcmp result.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[0x10] and arg2[0x10] and computes a signed comparison, encoding the result in a small integer.",
    "Repeats the comparison for arg1[0x11] and arg2[0x11] and combines both comparison outcomes into a single integer result.",
    "If the combined numeric result is zero (both fields equal), it calls strcmp on the strings pointed to by arg1 and arg2 and returns that result."
