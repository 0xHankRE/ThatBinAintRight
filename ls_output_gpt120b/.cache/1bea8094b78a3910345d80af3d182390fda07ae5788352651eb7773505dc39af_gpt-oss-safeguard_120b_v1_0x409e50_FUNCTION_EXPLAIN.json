  "summary": "sub_409e50 validates two objects by checking a type field at offset 0x15 and a flag in a 32\u2011bit field at offset 0xAC, then conditionally compares their file extensions via a tail call to sub_409d10. If the type or flag checks differ, it returns the numeric difference; otherwise it delegates to sub_409d10 which uses strcmp on the extensions.",
  "details": [
    "Reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] to determine if they equal 3 or 9, setting a boolean rdx_1 for arg1.",
    "If arg2's type is 3 or 9, sets rax_3 = 1; otherwise computes rax_3 based on whether bits 0xf000 of the dword at offset 0xAC equal 0x4000.",
    "When arg1's type is not 3 or 9, also checks the same flag for arg1 and returns the difference if the flag values differ.",
    "If the type/flag checks pass, tail\u2011calls sub_409d10(arg2, arg1, strcmp) which extracts file extensions with strrchr and compares them using strcmp.",
    "Returns either a numeric mismatch indicator or the result of the extension comparison."
