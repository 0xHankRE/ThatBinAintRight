  "summary": "The function compares two objects by checking a type field at offset 0x15 and a flag at offset 0xac, returning a numeric difference if they differ, otherwise falling back to a lexical string comparison of their name fields.",
  "details": [
    "It reads a byte at offset 0x15 from each argument and checks if the value is 3 or 9, using this to set a boolean flag.",
    "It examines the 32\u2011bit value at offset 0xac, masks it with 0xf000, and tests for the constant 0x4000, using the result to influence the return value.",
    "If the earlier checks indicate a mismatch, it returns the difference of the boolean flags; otherwise it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
