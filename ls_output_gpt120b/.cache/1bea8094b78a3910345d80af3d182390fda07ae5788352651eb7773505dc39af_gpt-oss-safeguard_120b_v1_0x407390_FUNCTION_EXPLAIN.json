  "summary": "The function acts as a comparator for two data structures: it first compares integer fields at offsets 0xE and 0xF, returning a non\u2011zero ordering value if they differ; if those fields are equal it falls back to a lexical comparison of the strings referenced by the first pointer in each structure via strcmp.",
  "details": [
    "Loads 64\u2011bit values from arg1[0xE] and arg2[0xE] and computes a signed/unsigned comparison, contributing to the result.",
    "Loads 64\u2011bit values from arg1[0xF] and arg2[0xF] and performs a second comparison, combining both results into a signed ordering integer.",
    "If the combined comparison result is zero, it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure and returns that result."
