  "summary": "The main function initializes the GNU coreutils program by extracting the executable name, handling libtool wrapper paths, setting locale and translation domains, and preparing global state before delegating to further initialization and option parsing routines.",
  "details": [
    "It extracts the base name from argv[0] using strrchr and adjusts it if the path contains '/.libs/lt-' (common for libtool), storing the result in program_invocation_name and program_invocation_short_name.",
    "It calls setlocale, bindtextdomain, and textdomain to configure internationalization for the \"coreutils\" domain.",
    "Global variables such as data_423460, data_423088, and others are initialized, and a subroutine sub_418d90 is invoked with a function pointer argument, likely to set up further program state or parse command-line options."
