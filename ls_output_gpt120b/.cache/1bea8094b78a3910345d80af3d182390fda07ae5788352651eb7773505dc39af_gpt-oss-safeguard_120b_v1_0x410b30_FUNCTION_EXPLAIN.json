  "summary": "sub_410b30 duplicates a null\u2011terminated string by allocating a buffer of the appropriate size and copying the contents, acting like a safe strdup implementation. On allocation failure it invokes an error handler (sub_40e430) and does not return.",
  "details": [
    "Computes the length of the input string with strlen and adds one for the terminating null.",
    "Allocates memory of that size using malloc; if allocation succeeds, copies the string into the new buffer with __memcpy_chk and returns the new pointer.",
    "If malloc returns NULL, calls sub_40e430 (likely a fatal error routine) and does not return."
