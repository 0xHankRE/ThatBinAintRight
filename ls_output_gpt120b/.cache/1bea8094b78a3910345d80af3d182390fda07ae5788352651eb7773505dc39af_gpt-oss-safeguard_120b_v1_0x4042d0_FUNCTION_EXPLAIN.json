  "summary": "sub_4042d0 initializes a local variable with the constant 0x2a and then tail-calls sub_404020, effectively delegating its functionality to that routine.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets var_8 to 0x2a, but the variable is not used before the tail call.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020, which appears to be a stub that does nothing meaningful (sets var_8 to 0 and jumps to nullptr)."
