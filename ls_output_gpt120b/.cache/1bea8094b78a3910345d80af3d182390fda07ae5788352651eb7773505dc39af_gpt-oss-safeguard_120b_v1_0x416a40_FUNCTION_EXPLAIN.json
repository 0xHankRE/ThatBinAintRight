  "summary": "sub_416a40 allocates and initializes a custom data structure. It first allocates a 0x50\u2011byte block, validates it with sub_40c7b0, computes an element count via sub_4168e0, allocates a buffer of that many 16\u2011byte entries with calloc, stores several arguments into the structure, and returns the pointer. On any failure it sets errno to 0x16, frees allocated memory, and returns nullptr.",
  "details": [
    "Allocates a 0x50\u2011byte struct with malloc and stores a sentinel pointer (&data_419600) at offset 0x28.",
    "Calls sub_40c7b0 to validate the struct; on failure sets errno (0x16) and frees the struct.",
    "Computes a count (nmemb) using sub_4168e0 with arguments arg1 and a float constant 0.8, stores it at offset 0x10.",
    "If nmemb > 0, allocates nmemb * 0x10 bytes with calloc, stores the buffer pointer, calculates the end pointer, and records arg2\u2011arg4 in subsequent fields.",
    "Initializes additional fields to zero and returns the initialized structure; otherwise frees resources and returns nullptr."
