  "summary": "The function at 0x4046d0 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its size argument to the standard malloc routine and returns the allocated pointer. It performs no additional processing, acting as a simple alias for malloc.",
  "details": [
    "The function consists of a single tailcall: return malloc(n);",
    "It imports the malloc symbol and calls the address 0x422fd8, which corresponds to the actual malloc implementation."
  ],
  "evidence_refs": [
    "imports:malloc",
    "call:0x422fd8"
  ],
  "unknowns": [
    "The reason for providing this wrapper (e.g., abstraction, instrumentation) is not evident from the code."
