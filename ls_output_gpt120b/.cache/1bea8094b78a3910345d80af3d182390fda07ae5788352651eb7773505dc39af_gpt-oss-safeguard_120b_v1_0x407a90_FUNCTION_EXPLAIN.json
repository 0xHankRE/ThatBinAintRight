  "summary": "The function acts as a comparator: it first compares the 10th 64-bit element of two structures, returning a signed difference if they differ, otherwise it falls back to a lexical string comparison of the first element.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[9] and arg2[9] and determines if one is greater, less, or equal.",
    "If the comparison yields a non\u2011zero ordering (one is greater or less), it returns 1 or -1 accordingly.",
    "If the values are equal, it delegates to strcmp on the pointers stored at arg1[0] and arg2[0]."
