  "summary": "The function at 0x404ac0 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its call to the imported stat function, returning its result. It performs a tail call without any additional processing or error handling. This suggests it serves as a simple alias or compatibility shim for the system stat call.",
  "details": [
    "The function contains only a tailcall to the imported stat routine.",
    "No string literals or additional logic are present, indicating it merely passes through arguments to stat."

  "evidence_refs": [

  "unknowns": [
    "Exact handling of arguments and return values (e.g., whether it modifies parameters before calling stat)",
    "Context of how this wrapper is used within the larger binary"
