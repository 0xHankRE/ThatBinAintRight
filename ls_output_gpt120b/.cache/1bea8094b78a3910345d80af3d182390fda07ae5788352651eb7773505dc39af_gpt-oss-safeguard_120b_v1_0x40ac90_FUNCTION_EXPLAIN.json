  "summary": "The function compares two file path strings by first extracting their extensions (text after the last '.') and comparing those extensions using locale-aware string comparison; if the extensions differ, it returns that result, otherwise it falls back to comparing the full original strings.",
  "details": [
    "It retrieves the last '.' in each input string via strrchr; if none is found, it substitutes a default string located at data_41af54.",
    "It clears errno, then calls strcoll on the two extensions; a non-zero result is returned immediately.",
    "If the extensions are equal, it calls strcoll again on the original full strings and returns that result."
