  "summary": "The function iterates over two input buffers, using indices rax and rdx, and checks each character to see if it is a decimal digit (0x30-0x39). It stops when either buffer length is reached or a non\u2011digit is encountered, returning 0 in the termination case.",
  "details": [
    "The loop compares characters from arg1[rax] and arg3[rdx] against the digit range by testing r10_1 - 0x30 <= 9.",
    "If the index rdx reaches arg4 (the length of the second buffer), the function jumps to a return of 0."
