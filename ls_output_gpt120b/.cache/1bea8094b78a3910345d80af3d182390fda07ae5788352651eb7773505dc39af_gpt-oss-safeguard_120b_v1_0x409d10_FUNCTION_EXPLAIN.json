  "summary": "sub_409d10 extracts the file extensions from two input strings, substitutes a default placeholder when a dot is missing, and then compares the extensions using a supplied comparator (typically strcmp). The function returns the comparator's result, effectively checking if the two paths share the same extension.",
  "details": [
    "Uses strrchr to locate the last '.' character in each input string (arg1 and arg2).",
    "If an extension is not found, substitutes a static string at data_41af54 (likely a default or empty extension).",
    "Calls the function pointer passed as arg3 (observed to be strcmp in callers) with the two extension pointers.",
    "Returns the result of the comparison, propagating a non-zero result directly."
