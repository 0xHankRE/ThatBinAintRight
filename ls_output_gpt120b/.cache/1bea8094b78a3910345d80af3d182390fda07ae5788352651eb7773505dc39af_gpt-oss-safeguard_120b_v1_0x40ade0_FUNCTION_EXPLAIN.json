  "summary": "sub_40ade0 performs a two-stage string comparison. It first calls a custom comparator sub_412600, returning its result if it indicates a difference, otherwise it falls back to the standard strcmp to compare the full strings.",
  "details": [
    "Loads two string pointers from the provided arguments and passes them to sub_412600.",
    "If sub_412600 returns a non-zero value (indicating inequality or a special case), that result is returned directly.",
    "If sub_412600 returns zero (strings appear equal under its custom rules), the function delegates to strcmp for a full lexical comparison."
