  "summary": "The function parses a numeric literal from a character buffer, handling different bases (decimal, octal, possibly hex) and returns the parsed integer while updating the input pointers.",
  "details": [
    "It reads characters from the buffer pointed to by arg2, converting ASCII digits by subtracting 0x30 and using a switch to handle digit ranges.",
    "State variable r10 controls parsing phases; when a digit is recognized it updates the accumulator r9 and advances pointers arg1 and arg2, storing the final value in arg4.",
    "The function returns zero on end-of-string or invalid input and updates the caller's pointers to the next unprocessed character."
