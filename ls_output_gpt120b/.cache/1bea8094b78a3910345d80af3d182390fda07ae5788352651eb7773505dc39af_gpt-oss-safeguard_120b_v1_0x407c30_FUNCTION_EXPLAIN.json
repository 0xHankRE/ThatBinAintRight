  "summary": "sub_407c30 is a thin wrapper that dereferences its two arguments as pointers to strings and forwards them to strcmp, returning the lexical comparison result.",
  "details": [
    "The function takes two arguments (arg1, arg2) which are pointers to pointers; it loads the 64-bit values at those addresses and passes them to strcmp.",
    "It performs a tail call to the imported strcmp function, effectively acting as a comparator (e.g., for qsort) that compares the referenced strings."
