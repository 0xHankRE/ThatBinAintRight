  "summary": "sub_40dde0 pushes a global 64\u2011bit value onto an obstack, allocating a new chunk when the current one lacks at least 8 bytes, updates the obstack pointer, and returns the stored value.",
  "details": [
    "It checks the remaining space in the obstack (arg1[4] - arg1[3]) and calls _obstack_newchunk(arg1, 8) if less than 8 bytes are available.",
    "It writes the global variable data_423350 into the current obstack position, advances the obstack's top pointer by 8, and returns the written value."
