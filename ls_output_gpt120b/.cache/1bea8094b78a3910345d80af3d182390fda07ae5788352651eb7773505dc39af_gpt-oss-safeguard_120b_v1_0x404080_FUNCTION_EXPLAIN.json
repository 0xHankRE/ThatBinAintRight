  "summary": "sub_404080 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 5 and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, which appears to be a stub that sets a local variable to 0 and jumps to a null address, effectively performing no meaningful work.",
  "details": [
    "The function defines a local int64_t var_8 = 5 but never uses it before tail\u2011calling sub_404020.",
    "sub_404020, the callee, sets its own local var_8 = 0 and then jumps to a nullptr, suggesting a no\u2011op or placeholder implementation."
