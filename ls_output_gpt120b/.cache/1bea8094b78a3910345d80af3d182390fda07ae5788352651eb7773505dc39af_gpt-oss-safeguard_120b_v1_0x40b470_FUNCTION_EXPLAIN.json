  "summary": "sub_40b470 implements a two-stage comparison of two objects. It first checks a cached numeric field at offset 0x19; if missing it computes the value via sub_40b040 using a global table and a size field. If the numeric values differ, it returns their difference; otherwise it falls back to a lexical string comparison using strcmp on the objects' name pointers.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a 64\u2011bit field at offset 0x19 from each argument; if zero, calls sub_40b040 with the object's base pointer, a global data pointer (0x4235a0), and a size field at offset 0xc4 to compute a fallback value.",
    "Compares the resulting 32\u2011bit values; a non\u2011zero difference is returned directly, providing a primary ordering key.",
    "When the primary keys are equal, the function delegates to strcmp on the first pointer of each object, providing a secondary alphabetical ordering."
