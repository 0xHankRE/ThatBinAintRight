  "summary": "sub_409b80 walks a list of entries, computes a hash for each using a callback stored at arg1+0x30, and inserts the entries into a hash table with chaining, updating the table's count and head pointer. It performs pointer manipulations to link nodes into buckets and handles empty bucket insertion.",
  "details": [
    "Iterates over a range defined by arg2[0] and arg2[1], processing each non\u2011null entry.",
    "For each entry, calls a function pointer at arg1+0x30 to obtain a hash value, checks it against the table size at arg1+0x10, and computes the bucket address using (hash<<4)+base.",
    "If the bucket is empty, inserts the node and updates the table's entry count at arg1+0x18 and head pointer at arg1+0x48; otherwise, re\u2011links nodes to maintain a chain.",
    "Uses abort and malloc imports (though not directly shown in the snippet) for error handling or allocation in related code paths."
