  "summary": "The function implements a three-way comparison of two objects: it first compares integer fields at offsets 0xe and 0xf, returns a non-zero ordering if they differ, and if they are equal it falls back to a locale-aware string comparison of the pointers stored at the objects' start, clearing errno before calling strcoll.",
  "details": [
    "Loads int64 values from arg1[0xe] and arg2[0xe] and computes a signed comparison result using both < and > flags.",
    "Repeats the comparison for int64 values at offset 0xf, combines the two comparison outcomes into a single integer result.",
    "If the combined result is zero, retrieves the first pointer from each structure, resets *__errno_location() to 0, and returns the result of strcoll on the two strings."
