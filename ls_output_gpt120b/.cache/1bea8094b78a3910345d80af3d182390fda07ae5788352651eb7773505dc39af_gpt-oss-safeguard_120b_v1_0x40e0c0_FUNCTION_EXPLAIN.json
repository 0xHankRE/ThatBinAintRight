  "summary": "sub_40e0c0 inserts a string referenced by arg2+0x30 into a null\u2011terminated string list stored in the structure pointed to by arg1, avoiding duplicates and expanding the buffer when needed. It handles empty strings specially, uses strcmp to compare existing entries, and allocates a new buffer via sub_408fc0 if the current buffer lacks space.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads a pointer (r13) from arg2+0x30; if null it does nothing.",
    "It iterates over the existing string list (starting at arg1+9) using strcmp to find a matching entry.",
    "If the string is not found, it checks for space; if insufficient, it calls sub_408fc0 to allocate a larger buffer and updates the structure.",
    "When space is sufficient, it copies the new string with memcpy and updates the list termination.",
    "An empty string case redirects to a default string at data_41af54."
