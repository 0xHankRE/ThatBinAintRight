  "summary": "sub_408a60 configures signal handling based on its argument: when called with a false argument it clears handlers for a predefined list of signals, and when called with a true argument it builds a signal mask of those signals that are not set to a specific action, storing the mask in global data structures.",
  "details": [
    "Iterates over a static array of signal numbers (data_41ad80 to data_41adb0) and checks membership in a signal set (data_423740) using sigismember.",
    "If arg1 is zero, it resets each listed signal's handler to the default by calling signal(sig, nullptr).",
    "If arg1 is non-zero, it initializes an empty signal set, queries each signal's current action with sigaction, adds signals not having a specific action (var_d8 != 1) to the set with sigaddset, and stores the resulting mask in global variables (data_423740, data_423750, data_423760)."
