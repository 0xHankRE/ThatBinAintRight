  "summary": "The function checks whether a given message string has a translation and then determines if the current locale uses UTF-8 encoding. If the locale encoding is UTF-8 (case\u2011insensitively), it returns the second argument; otherwise it falls back to a default handling path. It uses dcgettext to fetch a translation and nl_langinfo(CODESET) to query the character set.",
  "details": [
    "Calls dcgettext(nullptr, arg1, 5) and compares the returned pointer to arg1 to detect missing translation.",
    "Retrieves the current locale's character set via nl_langinfo(0xe) and defaults to \"ASCII\" if unavailable.",
    "Performs a case\u2011insensitive comparison of the locale string against \"UTF-8\" using a manual loop.",
    "If the locale is UTF-8, the function returns arg2; otherwise it proceeds to alternative logic (not shown)."
