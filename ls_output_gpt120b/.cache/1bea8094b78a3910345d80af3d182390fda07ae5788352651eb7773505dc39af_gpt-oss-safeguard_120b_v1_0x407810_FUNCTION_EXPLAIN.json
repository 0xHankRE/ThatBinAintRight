  "summary": "sub_407810 is a comparator that orders two objects by first comparing a 64\u2011bit field at offset 0xE, then a field at offset 0xF, and finally falling back to a lexical string comparison of the pointers at the start of each object.",
  "details": [
    "It loads arg1[0xE] and arg2[0xE] and computes a boolean result based on < and > comparisons, contributing to a numeric result.",
    "It then loads arg1[0xF] and arg2[0xF] and similarly contributes to the result; if the combined result is non\u2011zero it returns it.",
    "When the numeric fields are equal (result == 0), it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the first 8\u2011byte pointers of each argument to break the tie."
