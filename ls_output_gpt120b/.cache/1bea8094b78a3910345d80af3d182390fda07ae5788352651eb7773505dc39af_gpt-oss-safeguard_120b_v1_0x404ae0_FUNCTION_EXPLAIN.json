  "summary": "The function at 0x404ae0 is a thin wrapper that directly tail-calls the imported __isoc23_strtoumax routine, returning its result without additional processing. It serves as a local alias or forwarding stub for the standard library conversion function that parses a string to a uintmax_t value.",
  "details": [
    "The body consists solely of a return statement invoking __isoc23_strtoumax, indicating no extra logic or argument manipulation.",
    "The function imports __isoc23_strtoumax and its only callee is at address 0x422e48, confirming it forwards control to the standard conversion routine."
