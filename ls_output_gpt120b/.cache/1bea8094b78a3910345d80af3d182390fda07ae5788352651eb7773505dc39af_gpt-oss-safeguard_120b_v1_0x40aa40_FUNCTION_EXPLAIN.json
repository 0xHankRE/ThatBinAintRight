  "summary": "The function validates specific fields of two structures, checks a flag mask, clears errno, and then performs a locale-aware string comparison using strcoll, returning either the comparison result or a difference based on mismatched flags.",
  "details": [
    "It reads a byte at offset 0x15 from both arguments and checks if either value equals 3 or 9, setting a combined flag rcx_1.",
    "It examines bits masked by 0xf000 at offset 0xac of the structures, comparing them against 0x4000, and returns the difference if they do not match expected values.",
    "If the preliminary checks pass, it clears errno via __errno_location and delegates the actual string comparison to strcoll using the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
