  "summary": "The function at 0x404960 is a thin wrapper that forwards its arguments to the imported __overflow routine, returning its result directly. It is used by other code to handle stdio buffer overflow conditions by delegating to the actual __overflow implementation.",
  "details": [
    "The function contains a single tail-call: return __overflow(f, ch);",
    "It imports the __overflow symbol and its only callee is at address 0x422d88, indicating it simply forwards to the real overflow handler."
