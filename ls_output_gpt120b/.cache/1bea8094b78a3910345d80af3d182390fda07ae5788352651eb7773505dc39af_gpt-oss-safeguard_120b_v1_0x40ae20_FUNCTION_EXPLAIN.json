  "summary": "sub_40ae20 compares two objects by first checking type codes and a flag field, then performs a custom string comparison via sub_412600 and falls back to a standard strcmp, returning an ordering or difference value.",
  "details": [
    "It reads a byte at offset 0x15 from each argument and treats values 3 or 9 specially, setting a flag rdx_1.",
    "It checks a masked field at offset 0xac for the bit pattern 0x4000 and uses this to influence the return value before any string comparison.",
    "If the preliminary checks pass, it extracts pointers from the start of each argument and calls sub_412600 for a specialized comparison; if that yields zero it calls strcmp on the pointed strings.",
    "The function returns either the result of the flag/field comparison, the result of sub_412600, or the strcmp result."
