  "summary": "sub_404230 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x20 and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, returning whatever that function returns. The called function appears to be a stub that does nothing meaningful.",
  "details": [
    "Sets a local variable var_8 to the constant 0x20 but does not use it before the tail call.",
    "Immediately tail\u2011calls sub_404020 and returns its result, acting as a simple forwarder."

  "evidence_refs": [

  "unknowns": [
    "The purpose of the var_8 assignment and whether it influences sub_404020 via registers or stack.",
    "The actual behavior of sub_404020, which shows a jump to nullptr and may be a placeholder."
