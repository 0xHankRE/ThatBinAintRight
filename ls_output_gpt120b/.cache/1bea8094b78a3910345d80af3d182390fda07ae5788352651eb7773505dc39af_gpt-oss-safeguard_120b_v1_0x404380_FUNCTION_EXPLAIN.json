  "summary": "sub_404380 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x35 and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, returning its result.",
  "details": [
    "The function defines a local int64_t variable var_8 and assigns it the constant 0x35, but the variable is never used elsewhere.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020, effectively delegating all further execution to that function."

    "The actual behavior of sub_404020, which appears to set var_8 to 0 and jump to a null pointer, but its effect is unclear."
