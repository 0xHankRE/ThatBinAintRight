  "summary": "sub_40ada0 compares two strings by first invoking a custom comparison routine (sub_412600) that handles special cases, and if that routine reports equality it falls back to a standard strcmp for a full lexical comparison.",
  "details": [
    "Loads the first characters of the input strings and calls sub_412600(rbx, r12) to perform a preliminary check.",
    "If sub_412600 returns a non-zero result (indicating a difference), that result is returned directly.",
    "If sub_412600 reports equality (returns zero), the function tail\u2011calls the standard library strcmp to complete the comparison."
