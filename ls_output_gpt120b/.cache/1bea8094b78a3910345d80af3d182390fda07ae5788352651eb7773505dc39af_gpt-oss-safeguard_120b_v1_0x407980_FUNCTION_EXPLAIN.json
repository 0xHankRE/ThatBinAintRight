  "summary": "sub_407980 compares two data structures, first checking a type field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, then evaluating a flag mask at offset 0xac. If the flag condition matches, it compares two coordinate fields (offsets 0xe and 0xf) for equality; when all checks succeed it falls back to a string comparison via strcmp. Otherwise it returns a boolean-like result based on the flag comparison.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] and proceeds only if either value is 3 or 9.",
    "It checks whether the high nibble of the dword at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 equals 0x4000 for each argument.",
    "If the flag check fails, it returns the difference of the flag results (result = rax_3 - rdi).",
    "When the flag check passes, it compares the 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0xe and 0xf of both structures, forming a composite result; a zero result triggers a tail\u2011call to strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure.",
    "The only external call made is to strcmp (imported at 0x4046c0)."
