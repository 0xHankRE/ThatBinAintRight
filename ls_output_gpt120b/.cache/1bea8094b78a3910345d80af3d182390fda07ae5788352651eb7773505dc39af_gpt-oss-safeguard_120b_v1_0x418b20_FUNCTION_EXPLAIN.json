  "summary": "sub_418b20 formats and prints data based on several global flags. It may clear internal buffers, convert a numeric argument to a decimal string, and output it with a width specifier using __printf_chk.",
  "details": [
    "If data_423342 is set and sub_40bbb0(4) returns true, it calls sub_40be90 on three data structures, likely resetting or printing them.",
    "When data_423349 is true, it builds a decimal string from arg1[4] (if arg1[0x17] is set) using manual division, then prints it with a field width (data_4232c4) via __printf_chk(\"%*s \").",
    "A similar block guarded by data_423348 prints another string from a global buffer.",
    "The function reads the stack guard value (fsbase+0x28) but does not otherwise use it, indicating stack protection."
