  "summary": "sub_404440 initializes a local variable with the constant 0x41 and then tail-calls sub_404020, effectively acting as a thin wrapper that forwards execution to sub_404020.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets var_8 to 0x41, but the variable is not used elsewhere before the tail call.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020 and returns its result directly."
