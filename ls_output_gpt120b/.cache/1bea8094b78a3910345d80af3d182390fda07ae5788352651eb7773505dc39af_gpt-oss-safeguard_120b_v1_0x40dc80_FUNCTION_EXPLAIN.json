    "Sets bit 0 of the flags field at offset 0xa in the obstack struct (arg1[0xa] |= 1).",
    "Stores the provided arguments arg4, arg5, and arg6 into fields at offsets 7, 8, and 9 of the struct.",
    "Tail\u2011calls sub_407ed0 with the same arguments to complete the obstack initialization, including chunk size handling and allocation."
