  "summary": "sub_4040d0 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 10 and then tail-calls sub_404020, which appears to be a stub that sets a local variable to zero and jumps to a null address, effectively doing nothing useful.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets var_8 = 0xa (10) but does not use it before calling sub_404020.",
    "sub_404020 sets its own var_8 = 0 and then jumps to a nullptr, indicating a placeholder or no-op implementation."
