  "summary": "sub_409070 acts as a wrapper around sub_411f60, invoking it to process an input argument and returning either the parsed result or an error code while enforcing stack canary protection.",
  "details": [
    "It reads the stack canary from the FS segment, calls sub_411f60 with the provided argument and a static data reference (0x41af54), and captures the result in result_1.",
    "If sub_411f60 returns 0, the function returns result_1 (clamped to zero if negative); otherwise it returns -1 for any non\u20111 error code, and finally verifies the canary before returning."
