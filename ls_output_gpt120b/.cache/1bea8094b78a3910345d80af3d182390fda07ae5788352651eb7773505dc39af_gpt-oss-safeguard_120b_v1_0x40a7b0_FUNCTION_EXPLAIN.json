  "summary": "The function performs a two-tier comparison of two objects. It first compares a 64-bit field at offset 9 (index 9) of each argument, returning -1, 0, or 1 based on that numeric ordering. If the numeric fields are equal, it resets errno and delegates to the locale-aware string comparison function strcoll on the pointers stored at the start of each object.",
  "details": [
    "Reads int64_t values from arg1[9] and arg2[9] and determines if one is greater, less, or equal.",
    "If the numeric comparison yields a non-zero ordering, returns the sign of the difference (1 for less, -1 for greater).",
    "When the numeric fields are equal, loads the first pointer from each argument, clears errno via __errno_location, and calls strcoll to compare the referenced strings."
