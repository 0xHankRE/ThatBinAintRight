  "summary": "The function performs a case\u2011insensitive comparison of two byte buffers (likely strings) up to a given length, returning the difference of the first mismatched characters (or zero if they match).",
  "details": [
    "Iterates byte\u2011by\u2011byte using rcx as an index, reading from arg1 and arg2.",
    "Converts any uppercase ASCII letters (A\u2011Z) to lowercase by adding 0x20 before comparison.",
    "Stops when the end of the specified length (arg3), a null byte, or a mismatch is encountered.",
    "Returns the signed difference between the two characters at the point of divergence."

    "Exact types of arg1, arg2 (e.g., char* vs. other buffers) and handling of non\u2011ASCII characters",
