  "summary": "sub_404340 initializes a local variable with the constant 0x31 and then tail-calls sub_404020, returning whatever that function returns. The called function appears to be a stub that does nothing meaningful.",
  "details": [
    "The function sets var_8 to 0x31, but the variable is never used before the tail call.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020, effectively delegating its behavior.",
    "sub_404020 sets its own var_8 to 0 and then jumps to a null pointer, indicating it likely does nothing or is a placeholder."
