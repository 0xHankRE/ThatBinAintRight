  "summary": "The function computes a simple rolling hash over a null\u2011terminated byte sequence pointed to by the first argument, then mixes the result with a secondary value from arg1 and reduces it modulo arg2.",
  "details": [
    "It dereferences arg1 to obtain a pointer to the data buffer and reads bytes until a zero terminator is encountered.",
    "During the loop it rotates the accumulator left by 9 bits (ROLQ) and adds each byte value, forming a rolling hash.",
    "If the first byte is zero, it returns a fallback value based on arg1[1] modulo arg2.",
    "Otherwise, after processing all bytes, it XORs the hash with arg1[1], applies COMBINE and a final modulo arg2 before returning."

  "evidence_refs": [],
  "unknowns": [
    "Exact definition of the COMBINE macro and the layout of arg1 (what arg1[1] represents).",
