  "summary": "sub_40be90 performs a one\u2011time initialization guarded by data_4237c0, checks the process group of stdout via tcgetpgrp and may invoke sub_408a60, then recursively processes a set of data structures before finally writing a buffer to stdout using fwrite_unlocked.",
  "details": [
    "If data_4237c0 is not set, it is marked as initialized and tcgetpgrp(1) is called; on success sub_408a60(1) is invoked.",
    "Depending on the flag data_4230e8, the function recursively calls itself on three or one global data blocks (data_4230c0, data_4230f0, data_4230d0, or data_4230e0).",
    "The function ends with a tail call to fwrite_unlocked, writing one item of size *(uint64_t*)arg1 from buffer arg1[1] to stdout."
