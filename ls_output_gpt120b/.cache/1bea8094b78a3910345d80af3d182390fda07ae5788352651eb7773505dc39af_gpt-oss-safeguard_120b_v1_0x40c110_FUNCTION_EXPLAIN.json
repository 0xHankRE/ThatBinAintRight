  "summary": "The function scans a buffer of length given by the second argument, looking for a '.' character followed by alphabetic characters (A\u2011Z, a\u2011z) or a tilde '~', likely to detect or validate a file extension within the string.",
  "details": [
    "It reads the length of the input string from arg2 (rdi) and iterates over the buffer arg1 using an index (result_1).",
    "When a '.' (0x2e) is found, it checks the next character to ensure it is a letter or '~', then continues advancing the index over subsequent valid extension characters."
