  "summary": "The function implements a multi\u2011stage comparison between two data structures pointed to by arg1 and arg2. It first checks a type field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, then examines a flag in the 0xac offset masked with 0xf000, followed by a numeric comparison of the value at index 9. If those checks deem the objects equal, it clears errno and performs a locale\u2011aware string comparison via strcoll on the pointers stored at the structures' base addresses.",
  "details": [
    "If arg1[0x15] or arg2[0x15] equals 3 or 9, a flag (rax_3) is set to 1, otherwise the function skips further comparison.",
    "When both objects have the same flag condition, it checks whether the high\u2011order bits (0xf000) of the dword at offset 0xac equal 0x4000 for each object, influencing the result.",
    "It then compares the 64\u2011bit values at index 9 of each structure, returning the difference unless they are equal.",
    "When all prior fields match, it resets *__errno_location()* to 0 and calls strcoll on the strings referenced by the first pointer of each structure, returning that result."
