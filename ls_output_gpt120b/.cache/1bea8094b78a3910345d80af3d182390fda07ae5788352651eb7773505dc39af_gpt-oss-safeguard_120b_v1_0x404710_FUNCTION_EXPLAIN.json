  "summary": "The function at 0x404710 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its arguments to the imported sigprocmask system call and returns its result.",
  "details": [
    "The implementation consists of a single tailcall: return sigprocmask(how, set, oset);",
    "No additional logic, string handling, or side effects are present; it simply proxies the call."
