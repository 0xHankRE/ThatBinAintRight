  "summary": "sub_40a3f0 compares two objects by inspecting two integer fields at offsets 0xc and 0xd; it returns a non\u2011zero ordering value if those fields differ. If the numeric fields are equal, it clears errno and delegates to strcoll to perform a locale\u2011aware string comparison of the pointers stored at the objects' first fields. The result is used as a combined ordering metric.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[0xc] and arg2[0xc] and computes a signed comparison, contributing to the result.",
    "Loads arg1[0xd] and arg2[0xd] and computes another signed comparison, also contributing to the result.",
    "If the combined numeric comparison result is zero, retrieves the first pointer from each argument, resets errno via __errno_location, and calls strcoll to compare the strings.",
    "Returns either the numeric comparison result or the strcoll result."
