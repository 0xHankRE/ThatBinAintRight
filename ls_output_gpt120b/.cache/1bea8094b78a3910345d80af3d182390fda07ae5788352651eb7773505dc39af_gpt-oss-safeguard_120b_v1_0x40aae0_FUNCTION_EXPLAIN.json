  "summary": "The function compares specific fields of two structures, checks for particular flag values, and if those checks pass it clears errno and performs a locale-aware string comparison using strcoll, returning the comparison result. If the flag conditions differ, it returns a numeric difference based on those flags.",
  "details": [
    "It reads a byte at offset 0x15 from both arguments and checks if either value equals 3 or 9, setting a combined flag rdx_1.",
    "It examines a 32\u2011bit field at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 to see if it equals 0x4000, using this to compute a return value when the flag conditions differ.",
    "When the flag checks succeed, it clears errno via __errno_location and calls strcoll with the second argument's string pointer as the first parameter and the first argument's string pointer as the second.",
    "The function returns either the difference of flag-derived values or the result of strcoll."
