  "summary": "sub_4044e0 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 0x4b and then tail-calls sub_404020, returning its result. The called function appears to be a stub that sets a local variable to zero and jumps to a null pointer, indicating no meaningful operation.",
  "details": [
    "The function defines a local variable var_8 = 0x4b but does not use it before making a tail call to sub_404020.",
    "sub_404020 sets its own var_8 to zero and then jumps to a nullptr, suggesting it performs no action and likely returns a default value."
