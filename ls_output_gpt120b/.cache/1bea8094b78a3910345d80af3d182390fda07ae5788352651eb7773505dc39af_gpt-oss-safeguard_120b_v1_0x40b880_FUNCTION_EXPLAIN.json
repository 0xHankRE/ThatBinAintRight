  "summary": "The function checks for pending write errors on stdout and stderr, reports a \"write error\" via error() if stdout fails, and then terminates the process; if only stderr fails it exits silently, otherwise it returns normally.",
  "details": [
    "Calls sub_40b810 on stdout; if it indicates an error, retrieves a localized \"write error\" string with dcgettext, logs it with error(), and exits using _exit with data_423088 as status.",
    "If stdout is fine, it calls sub_40b810 on stderr; if that indicates an error, it exits with the same status without reporting.",
    "If neither stream reports an error, the function simply returns."
