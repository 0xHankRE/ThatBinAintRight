  "summary": "The function at 0x404720 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its arguments to the libc __snprintf_chk function and returns its result without any additional processing.",
  "details": [
    "It imports __snprintf_chk and performs a tail call to it with the same parameters (s, maxlen, flag, slen, format).",
    "No other logic, string handling, or side effects are present; it serves as a simple pass\u2011through or compatibility shim."
