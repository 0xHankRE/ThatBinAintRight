  "summary": "sub_40b810 checks a FILE* for pending output and error conditions, invoking sub_40b6f0 to flush or sync the stream, then returns 0 on success or -1 on failure (with special handling for EAGAIN).",
  "details": [
    "Calls __fpending to get the number of pending output bytes for the file pointer.",
    "Inspects the FILE's flag 0x20 (likely the error flag) and calls sub_40b6f0 to perform flushing or state checks.",
    "If no error flag is set and sub_40b6f0 reports success, the function returns the result; otherwise it examines errno and returns -1 unless errno equals 9 (EAGAIN), in which case it returns 0.",
    "When the error flag is set and sub_40b6f0 reports no error, errno is cleared before returning -1."
