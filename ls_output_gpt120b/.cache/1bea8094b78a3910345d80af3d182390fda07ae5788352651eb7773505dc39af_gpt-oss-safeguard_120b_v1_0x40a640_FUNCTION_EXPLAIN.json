  "summary": "sub_40a640 performs preliminary type and flag checks on two objects before delegating to sub_40a5d0 for deeper comparison. It examines a field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, and a masked flag at offset 0xac for the pattern 0x4000, returning a difference if they disagree. If the checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40a5d0 which compares additional numeric fields and finally performs a locale\u2011aware string comparison.",
  "details": [
    "Reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] to detect values 3 or 9, setting a combined flag rdx_1.",
    "If either object has those values, sets a baseline comparison result (rax_3 = 1).",
    "When the flag rdx_1 is false, extracts the high\u2011order bits (0xf000 mask) of a 32\u2011bit field at offset 0xac and checks for equality with 0x4000, returning the boolean difference if mismatched.",
    "If the flag is true but the masked check on arg2 fails, returns the difference between the masked result and 1.",
    "When all preliminary checks succeed, it tail\u2011calls sub_40a5d0 to compare further numeric fields and then calls strcoll on the objects' string pointers."
