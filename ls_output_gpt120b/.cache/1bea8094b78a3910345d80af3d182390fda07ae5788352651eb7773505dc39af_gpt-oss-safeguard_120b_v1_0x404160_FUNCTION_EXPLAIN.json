  "summary": "sub_404160 is a thin wrapper that sets a local variable to 0x13 and then tail-calls sub_404020, effectively delegating its behavior to that function.",
  "details": [
    "The function defines a stack variable var_8 = 0x13 but does not use it before the tail call.",
    "It performs a tail call to sub_404020, indicating that any further logic resides in the callee."

  "unknowns": [
    "The purpose of the var_8 assignment, as it appears unused.",
    "The actual behavior of sub_404020, which jumps to a nullptr placeholder."
