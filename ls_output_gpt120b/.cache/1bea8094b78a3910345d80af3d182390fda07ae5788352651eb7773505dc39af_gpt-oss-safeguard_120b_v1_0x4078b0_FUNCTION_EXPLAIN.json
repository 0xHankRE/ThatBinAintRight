  "summary": "sub_4078b0 compares two data structures, first checking a type field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, then evaluating a flag in the 0xac field masked with 0xf000 against 0x4000. If those checks pass, it compares range fields at offsets 0xe and 0xf, and finally delegates to strcmp to compare the strings referenced by the structures.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads a type identifier from both arguments (arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15]) and proceeds only if either is 3 or 9.",
    "It checks a flag in each structure: (*(uint32_t*)((char*)argX + 0xac) & 0xf000) == 0x4000.",
    "If the flag matches, it compares the 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0xe and 0xf of both structures, using both less\u2011than and greater\u2011than comparisons to compute a result.",
    "When all earlier conditions are satisfied and the computed result is zero, the function tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
