  "summary": "The function at 0x404b80 is a thin wrapper that simply forwards its FILE* argument to the __freading routine and returns its result.",
  "details": [
    "It performs a tail call to __freading(fp) without any additional logic.",
    "The function imports __freading and has no other strings or constants, indicating it exists solely to expose or alias __freading."

    "imports:__freading",

  "unknowns": [
    "Why this wrapper exists (e.g., symbol aliasing or compatibility layer) is not determinable from the code alone."
