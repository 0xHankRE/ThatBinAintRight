  "summary": "The function compares two objects by two integer fields at offsets 0xE and 0xF, returning a signed ordering value; if those fields are equal it falls back to a lexical string comparison of the pointers at offset 0.",
  "details": [
    "It loads 64\u2011bit values from arg1[0xE] and arg2[0xE] and computes a signed comparison result weighted by 2.",
    "It then loads values from arg1[0xF] and arg2[0xF] and computes a signed comparison result weighted by 1, adding both to form the final ordering.",
    "If the combined result is zero (both fields equal), it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
