  "summary": "sub_407670 compares two data structures based on type fields and flag bits, then optionally compares numeric range fields before delegating to a string comparison. If both structures have type values 3 or 9, or a specific flag (0x4000) is set, it checks the values at offsets 0xc and 0xd for equality; when those match it calls strcmp on the first member of each structure. The function returns the result of strcmp or a derived integer indicating mismatch.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads a type field at offset 0x15 from both arguments and sets a flag if either equals 3 or 9.",
    "When the type flag is set, it checks a flag bitmask ((value & 0xf000) == 0x4000) in the first argument to influence control flow.",
    "It then compares 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0xc and 0xd of the two structures, combining the comparison results into a temporary integer.",
    "If those numeric comparisons indicate equality, the function tail\u2011calls strcmp (imported at 0x4046c0) on the pointers stored at offset 0 of each structure.",
    "If the initial type/flag checks fail, the function returns a non\u2011zero integer derived from the flag test."
