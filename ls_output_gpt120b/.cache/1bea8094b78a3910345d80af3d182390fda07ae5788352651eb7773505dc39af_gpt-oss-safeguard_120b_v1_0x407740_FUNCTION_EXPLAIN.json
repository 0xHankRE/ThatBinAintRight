  "summary": "The function compares two data structures (arg1 and arg2) primarily when their type field at offset 0x15 equals 3 or 9. It checks a flag in a field at offset 0xac, compares two numeric fields at offsets 0xc and 0xd, and if those are equal it falls back to a lexical string comparison via strcmp.",
  "details": [
    "It first verifies that both structures have a type value of 3 or 9 (offset 0x15).",
    "It tests a flag by masking the 32\u2011bit value at offset 0xac with 0xf000 and checking for 0x4000.",
    "It then compares the 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0xc and 0xd of each structure, combining the results into a numeric comparison.",
    "If the numeric fields match, it calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure to perform a final string comparison."
