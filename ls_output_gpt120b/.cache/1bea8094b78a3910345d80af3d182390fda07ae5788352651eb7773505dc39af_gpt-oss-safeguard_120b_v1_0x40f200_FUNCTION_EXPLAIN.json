  "summary": "The function manages a growable data structure, doubling its capacity when needed, reallocating the main buffer (size 0x30 per element) and a secondary buffer of 8\u2011byte entries, while checking for overflow and aborting on allocation failure.",
  "details": [
    "It reads current capacity (data_423470), element count (data_423368) and a size parameter (data_423318) from global variables.",
    "If the current capacity is zero or insufficient, it computes a new capacity (nmemb_1 = nmemb * 2) and calls reallocarray to resize the primary buffer at data_423370.",
    "It then calculates a secondary allocation size based on remaining space and uses reallocarray to allocate a secondary array of 8\u2011byte entries, populating it in a loop.",
    "On any allocation failure it invokes sub_40e430, which prints \"memory exhausted\" and aborts execution."
