  "summary": "The function implements a two-stage comparator: it first compares the 10th 64-bit field of two structures, returning -1, 0, or 1 based on that numeric difference; if those fields are equal it falls back to a lexical comparison of the strings pointed to by the structures using strcmp.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[9] and arg2[9] (the 10th 64\u2011bit element) and determines if one is greater, less, or equal.",
    "If the numeric fields differ, returns 1 when arg2[9] < arg1[9] and -1 when arg2[9] > arg1[9].",
    "When the numeric fields are equal, it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
