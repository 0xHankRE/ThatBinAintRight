  "summary": "The function is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its arguments to the system reallocarray function and returns its result, performing no additional processing.",
  "details": [
    "It receives parameters optr, nmemb, and elem_size and immediately tail-calls reallocarray with those same arguments.",
    "The wrapper exists likely for abstraction or compatibility, delegating all allocation logic to the imported reallocarray."
  ],
  "evidence_refs": [
    "imports:reallocarray",
    "call:0x422cd0"
  ],
  "unknowns": [
    "Why the wrapper is defined separately instead of calling reallocarray directly throughout the code."
