It selects appropriate format strings based on the number of authors and writes them to stdout via __fprintf_chk and fputc_unlocked, handling optional arguments to control output.",
  "details": [
    "Loads localized strings such as \"GNU coreutils\" and various \"Written by\" formats, then calls __fprintf_chk (import) to output them.",
    "Uses dcgettext to retrieve translations for the strings before printing, indicating support for internationalization.",
    "Iterates over a list of author name placeholders, selecting the correct format string (e.g., \"%s (%s) %s\\n\") based on the count of authors.",
    "Writes the GPLv3+ license text and URL using fputc_unlocked for line breaks."
