  "summary": "sub_404060 is a thin wrapper that initializes a local variable to 3 and then tail\u2011calls sub_404020, returning whatever that function returns. sub_404020 sets a local variable to 0 and then jumps to a null address, effectively acting as a stub or termination point.",
  "details": [
    "sub_404060 sets var_8 = 3 but does not use it before tail\u2011calling sub_404020.",
    "sub_404020 sets var_8 = 0 and then performs a jump to a nullptr, suggesting no meaningful work is done."
