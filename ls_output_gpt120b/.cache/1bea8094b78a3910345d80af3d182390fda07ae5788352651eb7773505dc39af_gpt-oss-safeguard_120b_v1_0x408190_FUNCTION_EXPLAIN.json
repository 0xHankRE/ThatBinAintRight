  "summary": "The function prints a prefix string followed by a space\u2011separated list of 64\u2011bit integers stored in a buffer to stdout, then appends a newline. It checks the buffer length, updates the FILE object's internal write pointers, and uses __overflow if the output buffer is full.",
  "details": [
    "Computes the number of 8\u2011byte entries in the buffer pointed to by arg2 and only proceeds if more than 7 bytes are present.",
    "Writes the initial string (arg1) to stdout using fputs_unlocked.",
    "Iterates over each 64\u2011bit value in the buffer, printing it with __printf_chk using the format \" %ld\".",
    "After printing all values, writes a newline character, handling buffer overflow via __overflow if needed.",
    "Updates the FILE structure's _IO_write_ptr and sets a flag when the buffer is empty."
