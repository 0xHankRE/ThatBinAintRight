  "summary": "sub_40bc10 logs an error message, updates a global status flag, and enforces stack canary protection before returning.",
  "details": [
    "Retrieves the current stack canary from the FS segment and stores it in rax for later verification.",
    "Calls sub_413ce0 with a fixed size argument (var_68 = 4) to obtain a formatted error string, then invokes error(0, errno, arg2, formatted_string).",
    "Updates global variable data_42372c based on arg1: sets it to 2 if arg1 is true, otherwise sets it to 1 if it was previously zero.",
    "Verifies the stack canary after execution; if altered, calls __stack_chk_fail to abort."
