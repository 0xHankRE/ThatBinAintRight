  "summary": "The function is a thin wrapper around the locale-aware string comparison routine strcoll. It dereferences two pointer arguments to obtain string pointers, clears the global errno, then returns the result of strcoll on the second argument string compared to the first.",
  "details": [
    "Loads a char* from the memory location pointed to by arg1 and another from arg2.",
    "Resets errno to zero via __errno_location before invoking strcoll.",
    "Calls strcoll with the second string as the first parameter and the first string as the second, returning its integer result."
