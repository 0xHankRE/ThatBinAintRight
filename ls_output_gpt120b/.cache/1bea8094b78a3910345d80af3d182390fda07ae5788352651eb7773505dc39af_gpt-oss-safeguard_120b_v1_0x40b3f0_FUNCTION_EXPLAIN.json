  "summary": "sub_40b3f0 compares two objects by first checking a type field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, then examining a flag in the word at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 against the constant 0x4000. If the preliminary checks differ, it returns a numeric ordering based on those differences; otherwise it delegates to sub_40b340 which performs a string collation comparison.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] and sets flags when they equal 3 or 9.",
    "It extracts bits from *(uint32_t*)(argX + 0xac) using mask 0xf000 and compares the result to 0x4000.",
    "If the type/flag conditions mismatch, it returns the difference of the evaluated flags.",
    "When the preliminary checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40b340 to compare string data of the two objects."
