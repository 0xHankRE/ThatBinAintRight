  "summary": "The function checks a cached byte at address 0x423027; if it is non-negative it returns its lowest bit. If the cached value is negative, it calls isatty(1) to determine if stdout is a terminal, stores the result in the cache, and returns the result's lowest bit.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a global byte (data_423027) and uses its signed value to decide whether to use a cached result.",
    "If the cached byte is negative, invokes isatty(1) via a tail call to the imported isatty function, caches the returned value, and returns its LSB as a boolean."
