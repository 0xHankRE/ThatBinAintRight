  "summary": "sub_40aed0 compares two objects by first checking a type field and a flag field, then optionally performing a custom string comparison before falling back to a standard strcmp. It returns a difference based on mismatched flags or the result of the custom comparison, otherwise the lexical string comparison result.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads a byte at offset 0x15 from both arguments and checks for values 3 or 9, using this to set a flag (rcx_1).",
    "It then examines a 32-bit field at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 to see if it equals 0x4000, using this to compute a boolean (rax_3) that is compared against the flag, returning the difference if they differ.",
    "If the flag checks pass, it retrieves pointers stored at the start of each structure (arg1 and arg2) and calls sub_412600 for a specialized comparison.",
    "If sub_412600 returns non\u2011zero, that value is returned; otherwise the function calls strcmp on the two strings and returns its result."
