  "summary": "sub_40c840 walks a container structure passed in arg1 and frees all allocated elements, handling two cleanup paths depending on flags at offsets 4 and 8. It iterates over an array of entries, freeing linked lists within each entry, and finally frees the array itself.",
  "details": [
    "The function obtains the current errno pointer via __errno_location but does not modify it in the shown code.",
    "If either arg1[8] or arg1[4] is zero, it treats the structure as a simple array of pointers and frees each linked list found at offset 8 of each entry.",
    "If both flags are non-zero, it iterates over the entries, calling a function pointer stored at arg1[8] to free each node in a linked list until the list ends.",
    "Memory is released using the imported free function throughout the loops."
