  "summary": "sub_40b2c0 checks specific type codes (3 or 9) and a flag in a 0xac field of two structures, returns a difference if they mismatch, otherwise forwards to sub_40b210 for a locale-aware string comparison.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a field at offset 0x15 from both arguments and sets a flag if either value equals 3 or 9.",
    "If arg2's type is 3 or 9, it sets a temporary result to 1; otherwise it derives the result from a masked check of arg2's 0xac field against 0x4000.",
    "When arg1's type is not 3 or 9, it also checks arg1's 0xac field against 0x4000 and returns the difference between the two flag results.",
    "If all checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40b210, which ultimately calls strcoll to compare string data from the two objects."
