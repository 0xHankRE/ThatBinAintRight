  "summary": "sub_407ad0 implements a custom comparison routine for two structures, first checking a type field for values 3 or 9, then a flag masked with 0xf000, followed by a numeric field comparison, and finally falling back to a string comparison via strcmp if earlier checks indicate equality.",
  "details": [
    "The function reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] and treats values 3 or 9 as special types, setting a flag rcx_1 accordingly.",
    "It checks a flag at offset 0xac masked with 0xf000 against 0x4000 for each argument to influence the comparison outcome.",
    "If the type and flag checks pass, it compares the 64-bit values at offset 9 of both structures, using the result to decide further action.",
    "When the numeric fields are equal, the function delegates to strcmp to compare the strings pointed to by the first fields of the structures."
