  "summary": "sub_40a300 implements a comparator that first orders two objects by two integer fields at offsets 0xE and 0xF, returning a non\u2011zero ordering value if they differ; if those fields are equal it clears errno and delegates to locale\u2011aware string comparison via strcoll on the pointers stored at the start of each object.",
  "details": [
    "Loads 64\u2011bit values from arg1[0xE] and arg2[0xE] and from arg1[0xF] and arg2[0xF] and computes a signed comparison result using bitwise logic.",
    "If the computed result is non\u2011zero, it is returned directly as the ordering indicator.",
    "When the numeric fields compare equal, the function retrieves the first pointer from each structure, resets errno to 0, and tail\u2011calls strcoll to compare the associated strings."
