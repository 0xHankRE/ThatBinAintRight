  "summary": "The _start function is the program entry point that prepares the runtime environment and invokes __libc_start_main with the program's main function and stack end pointer, then never returns.",
  "details": [
    "It defines a stack_end variable and passes its address to __libc_start_main to inform the C runtime of the stack limit.",
    "It calls __libc_start_main with main, a return address placeholder, a ubp_av placeholder, two null pointers, an arg3 value, and the stack_end pointer, handing control over to the C runtime."
