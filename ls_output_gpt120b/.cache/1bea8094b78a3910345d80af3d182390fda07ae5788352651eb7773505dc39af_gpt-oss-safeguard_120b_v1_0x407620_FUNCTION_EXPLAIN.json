  "summary": "The function implements a custom comparator for two structures: it first compares 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0xC and 0xD, producing a signed result based on those numeric fields; if those fields are equal it falls back to a lexical comparison of the strings pointed to by the structures using strcmp.",
  "details": [
    "Loads two 64\u2011bit values from each argument at offsets 0xC and 0xD and evaluates <, > relationships to compute a small integer result.",
    "Combines the boolean outcomes into a single integer (result = (secondDiff) + ((firstDiff) << 1)).",
    "If the numeric comparison yields zero (both fields equal), the function calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure and returns that result."
