  "summary": "sub_404020 appears to be a dispatcher that jumps to a target based on a value set by its callers, using a jump table or indirect branch. Neighbor functions set a local var_8 to 0, 1, or 2 before tail\u2011calling this routine, suggesting the value selects different code paths.",
  "details": [
    "The function defines a local var_8 = 0 and then performs an unresolved jump (likely an indirect jump via a table).",
    "Neighbor functions sub_404030, sub_404040, and sub_404050 set var_8 to 0, 1, and 2 respectively before tail\u2011calling sub_404020, indicating var_8 is used as a selector."
