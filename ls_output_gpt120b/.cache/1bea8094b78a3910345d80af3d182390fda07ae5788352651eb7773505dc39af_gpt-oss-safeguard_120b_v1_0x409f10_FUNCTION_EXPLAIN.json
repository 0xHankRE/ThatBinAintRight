  "summary": "sub_409f10 is a cleanup routine that iterates over a global array of structures, frees several allocated pointers within each entry, conditionally frees a connection object, then resets the entry count and clears a related data buffer.",
  "details": [
    "If data_423318 (the entry count) is non-zero, the function loops from i = 0 to i < data_423318, retrieving a pointer from data_423450 + (i * 8).",
    "For each structure, it frees three pointers stored at offsets 0, 8, and 16 bytes (rbx_1[0], rbx_1[1], rbx_1[2]) using the imported free function.",
    "It then checks a pointer at offset 0x16 (rbx_1[0x16]); if it does not equal the global &data_423024, it frees it with freecon.",
    "After processing all entries, it sets data_423318 to 0 and zeroes a 0x2a\u2011byte region starting at data_4232a0 with memset."
