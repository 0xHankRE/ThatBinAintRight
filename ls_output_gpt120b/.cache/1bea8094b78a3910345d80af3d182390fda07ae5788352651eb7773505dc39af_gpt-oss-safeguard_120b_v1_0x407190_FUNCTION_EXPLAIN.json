  "summary": "The function acts as a comparator: it first compares two 64\u2011bit fields at offsets 0x10 and 0x11 of the two input structures, computes a numeric ordering result, and if those fields are equal it falls back to a lexical string comparison of the pointers at the start of each structure.",
  "details": [
    "Loads arg1[0x10] and arg2[0x10] and sets flags based on < and > comparisons, contributing to a result value.",
    "Loads arg1[0x11] and arg2[0x11] and similarly contributes to the result.",
    "Combines the comparison flags into a 32\u2011bit integer; if non\u2011zero, returns it as the ordering.",
    "If the numeric fields are equal (result == 0), tail\u2011calls strcmp on the strings pointed to by arg1 and arg2 and returns that result."
