  "summary": "sub_40c940 performs a conditional lookup followed by numeric processing of fields in a data structure. If a non\u2011null second argument is supplied it calls sub_409a50 to retrieve a cached entry; on success it stores the result in the third argument and returns. When the lookup fails it extracts two integer fields from the first argument, converts them to floating\u2011point values (handling negative values specially), and proceeds with further calculations before returning a status code, with stack\u2011canary protection throughout.",
  "details": [
    "Checks a stack canary at entry and exit using the FS segment guard (fsbase+0x28) and calls __stack_chk_fail on mismatch.",
    "If arg2 is non\u2011zero, calls sub_409a50(arg1, arg2, &var_38, 0) to perform a lookup; on a non\u2011zero return stores the pointer in *arg3 and returns 0.",
    "If the lookup returns zero, reads arg1[3] and arg1[2] (likely integer coordinates), converts them to floats with special handling for negative values, and computes derived floating\u2011point values (zmm5_1, zmm4_1).",
    "The function likely uses these computed values for further processing (e.g., validation via sub_40c7b0) before returning a result."
