  "summary": "sub_410b70 allocates a 32-byte structure, duplicates optional string arguments, stores a third argument, and inserts the new node at the head of a global linked list. It returns the previous head of the list and aborts on allocation failure via sub_40e430.",
  "details": [
    "Calls malloc (0x4046d0) to allocate memory for a new node; on failure it invokes sub_40e430 which does not return.",
    "If arg2 is non\u2011null, duplicates it using sub_410b30 (string copy with malloc) and stores the copy in the node's second field.",
    "If arg1 is non\u2011null, duplicates it similarly and stores the copy in the node's first field.",
    "Stores arg3 in the node's third field and the previous global list head (data_423720) in the fourth field, then updates data_423720 to point to the new node.",
    "Returns the previous head of the list (the value of data_423720 before update)."
