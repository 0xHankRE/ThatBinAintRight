  "summary": "The function compares two memory buffers: it first checks if the first 8 bytes of arg1 and arg2 are equal, and if so, it then checks if the second byte of each buffer matches, returning 1 only when both checks succeed.",
  "details": [
    "If the 64-bit value at the start of arg1 differs from that at arg2, the function returns 0 immediately.",
    "When the 64-bit values match, it evaluates whether arg1[1] equals arg2[1] and returns that boolean result."
