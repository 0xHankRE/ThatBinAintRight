  "summary": "sub_40a280 compares two objects based on a type field at offset 0x15 and a flag in the word at offset 0xac, returning a simple ordering value or delegating to sub_40a210 for a deeper comparison.",
  "details": [
    "It reads a 32\u2011bit value at offset 0x15 from each argument and checks if either is 3 or 9, using these as special type codes.",
    "A mask of 0xf000 on the dword at offset 0xac is compared against 0x4000 to derive a boolean flag for each object.",
    "If the type codes match certain conditions, it may return the difference of the flag values; otherwise it tail\u2011calls sub_40a210 for further numeric and lexical comparison.",
    "sub_40a210 performs additional numeric field comparisons (offsets 0xe and 0xf) and finally calls strcoll on the strings pointed to by the objects."
