  "summary": "sub_4168e0 computes a suitable allocation count (nmemb) based on input parameters, scaling and rounding the requested size, then adjusting it to an odd number and iteratively finding a value that satisfies certain divisibility constraints (likely a prime or non\u2011multiple of small factors) for hash\u2011table sizing.",
  "details": [
    "If arg2 is zero, the function derives a floating\u2011point estimate from arg1 and arg3, handling negative arg1 specially, then clamps the result within 64\u2011bit limits.",
    "The resulting integer is forced to be at least 10, made odd (|1), and then a loop uses magic\u2011number multiplication (\u20110x5555555555555555) to test divisibility, incrementing by 2 until a suitable value is found.",
    "The final value is returned and used by callers (e.g., sub_416a40, sub_40b590) to allocate memory for data structures such as hash tables."
