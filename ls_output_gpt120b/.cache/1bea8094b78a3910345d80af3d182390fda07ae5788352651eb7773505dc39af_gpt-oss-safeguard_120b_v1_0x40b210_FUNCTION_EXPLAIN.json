  "summary": "The function implements a locale-aware string comparison with a cached collation key. It retrieves a cached value from each object, computes it via sub_40b040 if missing, compares the keys, and falls back to strcoll on the actual strings, resetting errno to zero before the final comparison.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a 64\u2011bit field at offset 0x19 from each argument; if zero, calls sub_40b040 to compute a value using the object's string pointer, a global table (data_4235a0), and a length at offset 0xc4.",
    "If the computed or cached values differ, returns their signed difference; otherwise clears errno via __errno_location and returns the result of strcoll on the two string pointers stored at the start of each structure."
