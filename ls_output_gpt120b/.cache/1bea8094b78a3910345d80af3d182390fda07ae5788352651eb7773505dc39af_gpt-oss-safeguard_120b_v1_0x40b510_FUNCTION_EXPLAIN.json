  "summary": "sub_40b510 validates two objects by checking specific type codes (3 or 9) and a masked flag field at offset 0xAC against the constant 0x4000, returning a difference if they mismatch; otherwise it forwards the comparison to sub_40b470 for further checks.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a byte at offset 0x15 from both arguments and sets flags based on values 3 and 9.",
    "If either argument has type 3 or 9, it checks whether the high nibble of the dword at offset 0xAC equals 0x4000 and compares this flag between the two objects.",
    "When the type codes are not 3 or 9, it directly compares the masked flag of arg2 against the same constant.",
    "If all preliminary checks pass, it tail\u2011calls sub_40b470, which performs additional comparisons (including a possible string compare)."
