  "summary": "The function at 0x4048e0 is a thin wrapper that directly forwards its argument to the imported C library strlen and returns the resulting length. It performs a tail-call without any additional logic, serving as an indirect reference to the standard strlen implementation.",
  "details": [
    "Accepts a single pointer argument (arg1) representing a C-string.",
    "Calls the imported strlen function (callee at 0x422d48) and returns its result.",
    "No extra processing, string literals, or constants are used within the wrapper."
