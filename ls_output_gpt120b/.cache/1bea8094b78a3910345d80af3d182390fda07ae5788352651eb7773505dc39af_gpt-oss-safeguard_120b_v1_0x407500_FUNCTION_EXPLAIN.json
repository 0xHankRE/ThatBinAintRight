  "summary": "The function compares two data structures, checking a type field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, then verifying a flag in the 0xac field (mask 0xf000 == 0x4000) and matching range fields at offsets 0xe and 0xf. If all checks succeed, it delegates to strcmp to compare the strings pointed to by the structures; otherwise it returns a boolean-like result based on the checks.",
  "details": [
    "It reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] and proceeds only if either value is 3 or 9.",
    "It checks whether the high nibble of the dword at offset 0xac equals 0x4000 for both structures.",
    "It compares the 64-bit values at offsets 0xe and 0xf between the two structures, combining the results into a zero/non-zero flag.",
    "When the flag is zero (indicating equality), it tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers stored at the start of each structure."
