  "details": [
    "The function contains only a tail-call to the imported listxattr function and returns its result.",
    "No additional processing, argument manipulation, or error handling is performed within this wrapper."

  "unknowns": [
    "Exact arguments passed to listxattr (they are likely passed unchanged from the caller).",
