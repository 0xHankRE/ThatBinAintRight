  "summary": "sub_40a090 compares specific fields of two structures, checking for particular flag values (3 or 9) and a masked high-order bit pattern at offset 0xac, returning a numeric difference when mismatched, otherwise delegating to sub_40a010 for further comparison.",
  "details": [
    "Reads a byte at offset 0x15 from both arguments and sets flags if the value equals 3 or 9.",
    "If either argument has a flag of 3 or 9, it sets a temporary result to 1; otherwise it extracts the high 4 bits of a dword at offset 0xac, masks with 0xf000, and checks if it equals 0x4000.",
    "Compares the derived flag/result between the two structures; if they differ, returns the difference.",
    "When no early return occurs, it tail\u2011calls sub_40a010, which performs further numeric and string comparison."
