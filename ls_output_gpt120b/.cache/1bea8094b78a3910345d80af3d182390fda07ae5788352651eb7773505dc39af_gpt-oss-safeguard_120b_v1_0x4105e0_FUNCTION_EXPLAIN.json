  "summary": "sub_4105e0 is a simple dispatcher that checks a global index (data_423344) and, if within the range 0-4, jumps to a corresponding entry in a jump table located at 0x419180.",
  "details": [
    "The function first verifies that data_423344 is not greater than 4; otherwise it returns immediately.",
    "It then prepares stack space for saved registers and performs an indirect jump using the value of data_423344 as an index into jump_table_419180."
