  "summary": "The function compares two data structures, first checking a type field at offset 0x15 for values 3 or 9, then evaluating a flag in a masked field at offset 0xac. If those checks pass, it compares two 64\u2011bit fields at offsets 0xe and 0xf, and only if those numeric fields match does it fall back to a string comparison via strcmp.",
  "details": [
    "It reads arg1[0x15] and arg2[0x15] and proceeds only when either value is 3 or 9.",
    "A mask (0xf000) on a field at offset 0xac is compared against 0x4000 to influence the comparison logic.",
    "It then compares the 64\u2011bit values at offsets 0xe and 0xf of both structures, combining the results into a numeric 'result'.",
    "If the numeric fields are equal (result == 0), the function tail\u2011calls strcmp on the pointers at the start of each structure."
