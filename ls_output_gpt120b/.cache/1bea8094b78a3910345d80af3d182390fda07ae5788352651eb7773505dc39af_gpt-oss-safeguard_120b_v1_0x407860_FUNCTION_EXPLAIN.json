{
  "summary": "The function implements a comparator that first compares two 64-bit fields at offsets 0xE and 0xF of the two input structures; if they differ it returns a non-zero ordering value, otherwise it falls back to a lexical string comparison using strcmp on the pointers at the start of each structure.",
  "details": [
    "It loads arg1[0xe] and arg2[0xe] and sets flags for less/greater, then does the same for arg1[0xf] and arg2[0xf].",
    "A result is computed from the comparison flags; a non-zero result is returned immediately, otherwise strcmp is called on the first 8-byte pointers of the structures."
