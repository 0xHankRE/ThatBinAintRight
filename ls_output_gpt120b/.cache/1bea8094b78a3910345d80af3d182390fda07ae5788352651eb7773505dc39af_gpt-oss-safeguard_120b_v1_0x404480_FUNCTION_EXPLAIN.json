  "summary": "sub_404480 is a thin wrapper that sets a local variable to 0x45 and then tail-calls sub_404020, which appears to perform no meaningful work and jumps to a null address.",
  "details": [
    "The function initializes a local variable var_8 with the constant 0x45 but does not use it.",
    "It immediately tail-calls sub_404020, effectively delegating its behavior."

  "evidence_refs": [

    "The actual effect of sub_404020 since it jumps to a nullptr placeholder.",
