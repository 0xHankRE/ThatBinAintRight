  "summary": "The function writes whitespace characters to stdout between two indices, emitting a tab (0x09) at regular intervals defined by a global value (data_423708) and spaces (0x20) otherwise, handling buffer overflow via __overflow.",
  "details": [
    "If arg1 >= arg2 the function returns immediately; otherwise it iterates from arg1 to arg2.",
    "When the current position aligns with the next multiple of the global interval (data_423708), it writes a tab character, otherwise it writes a space.",
    "Writes are performed directly into the FILE* stdout buffer, falling back to __overflow when the buffer is full.",
    "After writing a tab, the index is advanced to the next interval boundary; after writing a space, the index increments by one."
